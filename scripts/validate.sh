# Compass script: validate.sh  -  SELF-CHECK FOR THE FRAMEWORK REPO
# =============================================================================
# A consistency check for the Compass repository ITSELF - not for a project using
# Compass. It checks the directory structure is intact and that the adapter
# layer's internal references resolve: commands referencing skills, agents, and
# templates that actually exist; no dangling pointers.
#
# Run it locally before committing, and in CI on every push.
#
# USAGE
#   scripts/validate.sh            # full check, human-readable
#   scripts/validate.sh --quiet    # only print failures + the final verdict
#   scripts/validate.sh --help
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0  everything resolves
#   1  one or more checks failed (details printed)
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS
#   1. The directories and top-level files the repo needs are present.
#   2. Every expected artifact template exists in templates/.
#   3. Every agent referenced anywhere in commands/ exists in agents/.
#   4. Every skill referenced anywhere in commands/ exists in skills/.
#   5. Every template referenced in commands/ exists in templates/.
#   6. Every script and hook referenced in the repo exists and is executable.
#      It skips an issue's own documents under docs/compass/<created>-<slug>/:
#      they record what was true when written, and a script renamed since is
#      not a broken reference in a living file.
#   7. The five reference approach docs exist and the rubric references them.
#   8. The kit layer is present: the CLI, the machine-readable governance,
#      the schemas, and the manifest.yml template - and `compass policy lint`
#      passes if python3 and the CLI are runnable.
#
# This script is deliberately dependency-free (pure bash + coreutils + grep).
# PyYAML ships in cli/vendor/yaml/, so a `compass policy lint` failure is a
# real lint failure and the script reports it as one.
