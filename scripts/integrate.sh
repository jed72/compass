# Compass script: integrate.sh  -  LAND THE WORKTREES BACK TOGETHER
# =============================================================================
# The ship-stage counterpart to multiagent.sh. It merges the per-subtask branches
# back into the base branch in a coordinated order, runs the project's test
# command for combined regression, reports any conflicts for the `orchestrator`
# to resolve, and cleans up the worktrees on success. Only the `orchestrator`
# agent runs this (the lead builder on a pair) - see CLAUDE.md and the
# worktree-multiagent skill.
#
# USAGE
#   scripts/integrate.sh <issue-slug>             # integrate every subtask
#   scripts/integrate.sh <issue-slug> --no-clean  # integrate but keep worktrees
#   scripts/integrate.sh --help
#
# ORDER
#   Subtasks are merged in the order they appear in distribution-map.md §3.
#   The map is expected to list shared foundations first (subtask-zero pattern,
#   see the worktree-multiagent skill) so dependents merge onto a base that already
#   has what they need.
#
# CONFLICTS
#   This script does NOT auto-resolve conflicts. If a merge conflicts, it
#   aborts that merge, leaves the repo clean, reports exactly which subtask and
#   which files conflicted, and stops. Resolving cross-subtask conflicts is the
#   orchestrator's job and no one else's - the script just surfaces them.
#
# COMBINED REGRESSION
#   After all subtasks merge cleanly, the project's test command runs once
#   against the integrated result. Per-stream green does not imply integrated
#   green - proving the combination is the whole point of ship. If combined
#   regression fails, worktrees are NOT cleaned up (you will need them) and the
#   script exits non-zero.
#
# IDEMPOTENT & SAFE
#   - A branch already merged is detected and skipped.
#   - Worktrees are only removed after both a clean merge AND green combined
#     regression. --no-clean keeps them regardless.
#   - On any failure the working tree is left in a clean, inspectable state.
