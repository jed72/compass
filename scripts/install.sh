# Compass script: install.sh  -  WIRE COMPASS INTO CLAUDE CODE
# =============================================================================
# Installs the Claude Code adapter layer (commands/, agents/, skills/, hooks/)
# into the right Claude Code locations and registers the hooks in settings.
#
# The methodology layer (docs/, governance/, approaches/, templates/) is NOT
# installed anywhere - it is read in place from this repo. What this script
# wires up is only the runtime adapter.
#
# USAGE
#   scripts/install.sh                 # project-local install (default)
#   scripts/install.sh --global        # user-global install (~/.claude)
#   scripts/install.sh --project DIR   # project-local into a specific project
#   scripts/install.sh --copy          # copy instead of symlink
#   scripts/install.sh --uninstall     # remove what a previous run installed
#
# DESTINATIONS
#   --global  : ~/.claude/{commands,agents,skills}/  + ~/.claude/settings.json
#   project   : <project>/.claude/{commands,agents,skills}/
#                                     + <project>/.claude/settings.json
#   hooks are referenced in place from this repo (COMPASS_HOME/hooks/), so the
#   settings.json entries point at absolute paths under this repo.
#
# IDEMPOTENT: re-running is safe. Existing Compass symlinks are refreshed;
# existing non-Compass files are never clobbered (the script stops and tells
# you). Hook registration is keyed by a marker so it is added exactly once.

# registration in DIR/.claude/settings.json AS WELL means every Edit/Write
# fires pre-tool.sh and post-tool.sh TWICE (symptom: doubled devlog
# entries). The detection looks for the manifest FILE - a stray
# .claude-plugin/ directory without plugin.json is not a plugin source.
#
# The guard is install-only and project-mode-only:
#   - On --uninstall we always want to strip prior registrations, regardless
#     of plugin presence (recovery for users already in the bad state).
#   - On --global we cannot reliably tell whether the user has the plugin
#     enabled in any of their projects, so the guard does not fire there.
