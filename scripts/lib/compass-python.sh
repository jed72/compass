# compass-python.sh - run python3 with the bundled PyYAML importable
# =============================================================================
# Shell scripts call compass_python, not python3, so every embedded reader
# imports the bundled PyYAML in cli/vendor/yaml/ and not whatever copy the
# machine has. The callers are hooks/pre-tool.sh, hooks/stop.sh,
# scripts/integrate.sh and scripts/multiagent.sh.
#
# This file does NOT know where cli/vendor/ is. It only knows the framework
# root, and puts cli/ on PYTHONPATH so `import compass_pkg` works - the vendor
# path itself is written down in exactly one place,
# cli/compass_pkg/__init__.py. A future move of the vendored tree is a
# one-line edit there, not a search-and-replace across every script that
# reads YAML.
#
# CONTRACT for every caller: open with these two imports, in this order:
#   import compass_pkg   # side effect: puts cli/vendor at sys.path[0]
#   import yaml
#
# Fork python3; do not exec it. exec replaces the calling shell, so a reader
# that cannot start ends the caller's script before its error handling runs.
# That switches hooks/pre-tool.sh off when the vendored copy is missing.
#
# EXIT STATUS 3 means the vendored PyYAML could not be resolved and the reader
# never ran, with the reason on stderr. A broken install must be reported, so
# callers must tell that apart from a reader that ran and found nothing - the
# ordinary absence of state.
