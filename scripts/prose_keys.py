"""The one list of YAML keys `tests/test_writing_style.py`'s `_yaml_spans`
reads as prose, and `scripts/compare-behaviour.py`'s YAML reader blanks as
prose - so the two halves cannot disagree about what prose is.

Before this module existed, each file held its own copy, and the two
disagreed: this list carried `biases` and `tests/test_writing_style.py`'s
did not. `governance/routing-policy.yml`'s `biases:` block was reworded by
this issue and no sweep read it, because the sweep's copy of this list
never named the key - found and fixed as finding 1, `review-dimensions.md`.
