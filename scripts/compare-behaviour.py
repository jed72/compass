"""Compares a batch's changed files against its merge base, to show that a
prose rewrite changed no behaviour: no printed string, no asserted string
and no code body. `prose-breaks-the-writing-style` needs this because
`verify.architecture` accepts only a `test-run` or a `command-output`
(`governance/guardrails.yml:182`), and this is the command that produces one.

Comparison, per file type:

- Python: the abstract syntax tree at both revisions, with a leading
  docstring stripped from every module, class and function body. Comments
  never enter an abstract syntax tree, so stripping the docstring is the
  whole of the work.
- Shell: the file with `#` comment text removed.
- YAML: every line with a `PROSE_KEYS` key's value blanked, and every
  whole-line or trailing `#` comment dropped - the same positions
  `tests/test_writing_style.py`'s `_yaml_spans` reads as prose, so the two
  halves cannot disagree about what prose is. A prose sequence item is
  blanked to one marker each, so rewording is free and adding or removing an
  item is not. Read as text, not parsed: `import yaml` outside
  `cli/compass_pkg/`, `cli/compass` or a `compass_python` heredoc does not
  resolve through this repository's one shared PyYAML mechanism
  (`tests/test_bundled_pyyaml.py`), and this script is none of those three.
- JSON: parsed structure, with `description` values blanked.
- Markdown: the contents of every fenced code block and every link target.
  A markdown file has no other behaviour.

The shell and YAML readers empty a line to remove prose from it, so they
compare the sequence of non-empty lines rather than the joined text. See
`_significant_lines`. The markdown and JSON readers cannot carry that
defect and do not use it: markdown collects the fenced lines and link
targets it cares about instead of blanking what it does not, and JSON
compares parsed structures, where neither formatting nor a line count
exists. `tests/test_writing_style.py` holds a case for each of the four, so
the two that are immune are recorded as checked rather than assumed.

`--allow-pinned-test PATH=REASON` excuses one test file entirely. The reason
is required and is printed beside the path, because an allowance nobody
explained is the same defect as a loosened matcher. The path must sit under
`tests/`, so the flag can never excuse a production file.

Exactly two things qualify, and nothing else:

1. A test whose assertion pinned wording this issue rewrites (`PBW-D6`). The
   prose and the assertion change in one commit, so the assertion change is
   not a behaviour change to find.
2. `tests/test_writing_style.py`, the mechanism file this issue's plan
   needs every batch to edit. Each batch deletes its own pending list and
   lowers `PENDING_PATHS_HIGH_WATER`, so every batch changes it. It is not
   audited surface: this issue introduced it and it has its own tests.

A production file, a test this issue merely happens to touch, or a real
behaviour change someone would rather not explain are all outside the flag.

WHAT THIS TOOL CANNOT SEE
=========================

The exit code is not a proof of no behaviour change; it is the result of the
comparisons below. `verify.architecture` rests on an architect's judgement of
the remaining differences (`DD-4`), and these are the gaps that judgement has
to cover.

- **Shell, across lines.** The comment scan reads one line at a time, so a
  quoted string or a here-document body spanning several lines is read as
  unquoted. A `#` inside such a body is taken for a comment and the text
  after it is dropped from the comparison.
- **Shell, beyond comments.** Two scripts with identical non-comment lines
  are called equal. Nothing checks that a command means what it did: a
  changed file mode, a renamed function used only by name, or a behaviour
  that depends on line numbers is invisible here.
- **YAML, one deliberate blind spot.** A prose key whose value is empty and
  whose children are a mapping keeps those children compared. That errs
  towards reporting a difference that is not one, which costs a second look
  rather than a missed change.
- **YAML, sequence items.** A prose sequence item's text is not compared at
  all, only the number of items. Rewording one is free by design, so a
  rewrite that changes what a tie-breaker actually advises is invisible here
  and only a reader can catch it.
- **YAML, read as text.** Values are compared as written, so a rewrite that
  turns a block scalar into a flow scalar reads as a change even when a
  parser would call the two identical. A quote spanning lines is read one
  line at a time, so a `#` on a continuation line is taken for a comment.
- **Markdown.** Only fenced code blocks and link targets are compared. An
  indented code block, a reference-style link definition and an HTML block
  are not read at all.
- **Python.** Only the abstract syntax tree is compared, with leading
  docstrings removed. A changed comment is invisible, which is intended, but
  so is a change that changes behaviour without changing the tree.
- **Any other file type** is reported as changed and left to the architect,
  because guessing would be worse.
