Produced by: whoever declares the incident - written at intake, before or
             alongside the hotfix work it triggers.
Lives at:    .compass/work/<task-slug>/incident.md
Role in the pipeline: the intake artifact that triggers a hotfix. SRE sense
of the word: what broke in production, the impact, the severity. The hotfix
reproduces from this, ships expedited, and settles its follow-ups (promote
the reproduction into proper acceptance criteria; optional postmortem)
before the issue fully closes.
