TEMPLATE: delivery-approach.md
Produced by: the assess stage (`/compass:assess`).
Lives at:    docs/compass/<created>-<issue-slug>/delivery-approach.md
Authority:   This is the audit centrepiece. It records the assessment, the
             delivery approach the policy computed, every policy rule that
             fired, and, as its own section, what was skipped and why it is safe.
             Rubric: the delivery-approach reference docs. Policy:
             governance/routing-policy.md (hard rules + soft biases).

On a spike, assess also writes a `.spike` marker file in the issue
directory so the pre-tool hook knows to suspend the TDD strategy.

Fill every {{PLACEHOLDER}}. A dimension with no justification is not an
assessment - ask the human instead. A stage with no "safe to skip because…"
line is not skippable - it runs.

# Delivery approach - {{ISSUE_SLUG}}

> **Issue:** {{ONE-LINE DESCRIPTION AS INVOKED}}
> **Assessed:** {{DATE}} by {{WHO}} · **Revision:** {{N}} (revision 1 = first assessment; bump on `--reassess`)
> **Reference shape:** {{quick fix | feature | initiative | hotfix | spike}}

<!-- On a re-assessment (`--reassess`), keep the prior revision below this
     line under a "## Superseded - revision <N-1>" heading so the history
     stays visible. -->

---

## 1. The assessment

<!-- Each dimension gets a value from the reference docs plus a one-line
     justification. No justification → ask, do not guess. -->

| Dimension | Value | One-line justification |
|---|---|---|
| **Risk** | {{trivial \| contained \| cross-cutting \| critical}} | {{Why this value. Consequence, not effort.}} |
| **Familiarity** | {{greenfield \| brownfield-mapped \| brownfield-unmapped}} | {{Why this value. Is current behaviour written down?}} |
| **Size** | {{atomic \| small \| standard \| large \| product}} | {{Why this value. When unsure, estimate up.}} |
| **Goal & role** | {{engineer \| product-owner \| product-marketer \| designer \| qa}} | {{Who invoked, and the outcome actually wanted - read `intent.md` or the intake if one exists.}} |

**Labels (the manifest's `labels:` field):** {{[auth, payments, personal-data, migrations, public-api, …] or "none"}}
<!-- These are what the policy's hard floors key on. Be honest - a one-line
     auth change still carries the auth label. -->

---

## 2. The composed candidate

<!-- The delivery approach assembled from the assessment, biased by the
     policy's soft defaults, BEFORE the hard rules are applied. Name the
     reference shape for shared vocabulary, then list deviations. -->

Candidate: **{{reference shape}}**, with these deviations from its reference form:

- {{e.g. "Test & review also runs the security dimension because the risk is cross-cutting." - or "none"}}

Candidate review dimensions: {{correctness, governance, traceability, … per the reference docs}}

---

## 3. Policy rules that fired

### 3a. Policy provenance

<!-- WHICH POLICY produced this approach. `compass approach evaluate` prints
     both lines below - copy them here. Without this, a reader months later
     cannot tell a genuinely light approach from one computed against stale
     governance. If the CLI reported drift, record it: an approach computed
     against a policy missing framework rules is an approach missing
     gates. -->

- Policy file: {{path to the routing-policy.yml that was read}}
- Policy version: {{the `version:` that file declares}}
- Drift: {{"none - the project's policy matches framework vX.Y.Z" - or "N rule(s)/check(s) missing against framework vX.Y.Z; see `compass policy lint`"}}

<!-- Every floor / cap / immovable gate / blocking role rule from
     governance/routing-policy.md that matched. Quote each one's rationale.
     If none fired, say so explicitly - silence is not a record. -->

| Rule type | Rule | What it changed | Rationale (quoted from the policy) |
|---|---|---|---|
| {{floor \| cap \| immovable_gate \| role_rule}} | {{e.g. the auth label}} | {{e.g. "Candidate quick fix raised to initiative-scale process weight."}} | {{"…"}} |

<!-- If nothing fired: "No hard policy rule fired. The candidate stands." -->

---

## 4. The final delivery approach

### 4a. Per-stage weight

| Stage | Weight | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Assess | Full | Always. This document is the output. |
| Define | {{one scenario \| small feature set \| full BDD discovery \| reproduce-first failing test \| collapsed to a question (spike)}} | {{discovery vs. behaviour mapping existing behaviour first; how deep}} |
| Refine | {{collapsed \| light pass \| full pass \| skipped (spike)}} | {{if collapsed, the de-scope ledger below must justify it}} |
| Plan | {{one-line edit note \| real technical-design.md \| technical-design.md + distribution-map.md \| timebox sketch (spike)}} | {{design decisions expected; governance check scope}} |
| Breakdown | {{skipped (solo) \| pair \| multiagent}} | {{subtask count comes from the distribution map}} |
| Implement | {{test surface target}} | {{scaled to risk - see the TDD skill}} |
| Verify | {{gate count}} | {{which review dimensions - section 4b}} |
| Ship | {{trivial commit \| coordinated merge}} | {{which follow-ups are owed - section 6}} |

### 4b. Gate set

- Number of gates: {{1 \| 2 \| all \| 1 conclude gate (spike)}}
- Review dimensions applied: {{list - correctness, governance, traceability are always on for delivery work; a spike runs none of these}}
- Immovable gates added (from routing-policy.md): {{verify.correctness, verify.governance, verify.traceability, …}}

### 4c. Multiagent orchestration

- Orchestration: {{solo \| pair (2-3 subtasks) \| multiagent (4+ subtasks)}}
- Subtask count: {{N - from distribution-map.md, or "n/a (solo)"}}
- Worktree root: {{from .compass/config.yml `multiagent.worktree_root`, default ../.compass-worktrees}}
- Cap in effect: {{e.g. "critical risk → max_worktrees: 1" - from a hard cap in routing-policy.yml - or "none"}}
- Orchestrator agent: {{yes (multiagent) \| no - lead builder integrates (pair) \| n/a (solo)}}

## 5. The de-scope ledger

<!-- THE AUDIT CENTREPIECE. Every stage or check that is collapsed or
     skipped, each with an explicit "safe to skip because…" line. A stage
     with no justification CANNOT be skipped - it runs. On initiative-scale
     work this table is empty by definition; cap-driven reductions go in
     section 4c, not here. On a spike the standing justification for every
     row is the same: nothing ships from a spike. -->

| Stage / check | Action | Safe to skip / collapse because… |
|---|---|---|
| {{e.g. Requirements review}} | {{collapsed \| skipped}} | {{e.g. "The acceptance criteria are a single scenario certified unambiguous at assess - nothing to review."}} |
| {{e.g. Design}} | {{collapsed to one-liner}} | {{e.g. "atomic size on familiar ground - no design decision; the design is 'edit src/foo.ts'."}} |
| {{e.g. Break down the work}} | {{skipped}} | {{e.g. "One subtask of work - parallelism would be pure overhead."}} |

**One-line edit note (quick fix / hotfix collapsed design only):** {{which file(s) to edit, or root-cause note}}

**Spike question + timebox (spike collapsed stages only):** {{the question to answer, and the timebox}}

---

## 6. Owed follow-ups

<!-- Work the issue deferred to go faster, which must be done at ship before
     the issue can close. A hotfix always owes one;
     other work owes whatever the de-scope ledger marked. A spike owes
     nothing - it ships nothing; its exit is graduate or discard. -->
<!-- absorbed: "<!-- Process weight borrowed from the front of the pipeline that must be settled" -->

- [ ] {{e.g. "Hotfix follow-up: this record completed properly, reproduction test promoted to a real scenario in acceptance-criteria.md, root-cause line in devlog.md."}}
- [ ] {{e.g. "none owed"}}

---

## 7. Human overrides

<!-- The computed approach is advisory until confirmed. Any assessment value
     or the final approach may be overridden by a human - recorded here with
     who and why. What CANNOT be overridden: an immovable gate, or a floor
     (a hard policy rule is governance speaking; changing it means amending
     governance/routing-policy.md, not overriding one issue's approach). -->

| What was overridden | From → To | Who | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| {{e.g. "Size"}} | {{standard → small}} | {{name}} | {{reason}} |

<!-- If none: "No human overrides. Approach confirmed as composed." -->

---

## 8. Confirmation

- [ ] Approach presented to the invoker and confirmed (or overridden - see §7).
- [ ] Every dimension in §1 has a justification.
- [ ] Every skipped/collapsed stage in §5 has a "safe to skip because…" line.
- [ ] On a spike: the `.spike` marker file is written to the issue directory.
- [ ] `devlog.md` opened with the assess entry.

Next stage: **define acceptance criteria** (`/compass:define`) - or explore, on a spike.
