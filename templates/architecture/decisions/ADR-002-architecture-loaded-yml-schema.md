## Context

When the assess stage loads the project's `architecture/` artifacts, it needs
to expose the result to downstream agents (spec-author, planner, architect) in
a structured, persistent form.  The first design placed this data in
`manifest.yml.assessment` - the existing machine-readable issue manifest.
However, `assessment` is the *judgement* block, where the router records its
four-dimension assessment.  Mixing mechanism-produced load state into the
judgement block violates the invariant that `assessment` is the only
judgement field.

## Decision

The assess stage writes a separate file: `.compass/work/<issue>/architecture-loaded.yml`.

Schema (version 1.0):

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"
loaded_at: <ISO timestamp>
artifacts:
  - path: <relative to project root>
    sha256: <hex digest>
    type: narrative | structured
    parsed: <inline YAML>   # structured artifacts only
adrs:
  - id: "ADR-NNN"
    path: <relative path>
    title: <string>
    status: proposed | accepted | superseded
```

The `sha256` field lets downstream agents detect whether an artifact changed
between assess time and when they read the loaded record.

## Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Why considered | Why rejected |
|---|---|---|
| `manifest.yml.assessment.loaded_artifacts` | Single file, no extra artifact | Violates the invariant that `assessment` is the judgement block only |
| Inline in `delivery-approach.md` prose | Humans can read it without a separate file | Agents need structured access; prose is not machine-parseable |
| Separate JSON sidecar | Already common in many tools | YAML is the project's standard; keeping it consistent reduces tooling friction |

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- `assessment` stays clean: only judgement, no mechanism state.
- `sha256` enables mid-issue drift detection.
- `parsed` on structured files means downstream agents do not re-read disk.

**Negative:**
- One extra file per issue in `.compass/work/<issue>/`.

**Neutral / follow-on:**
- The schema is versioned (`schema_version`); future additions are additive.
