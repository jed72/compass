## Context

The Definition of Done (DoD) in `verification-report.md` consisted of simple
checkbox lines (`- [ ] description`).  A human ticking the box was the only
way to mark a line done.  This meant "the test passes" could clear a DoD item
the same way as "branch protection is configured" - no distinction between
automated evidence and a human assertion.  Guardrail G4 (evidence, not
assertion) was eroding.

The framework needed a way for an unchecked DoD line to reference typed
evidence or an explicit backfill, so the check is mechanical rather than
relying on the human remembering to tick after actually doing the work.

## Decision

Two inline tag forms on the DoD line itself:

```
- [ ] (evidence: EV-<id>) <description>   → passes if EV-<id> is in manifest.yml.evidence with an accepted type
- [ ] (backfill: BF-<id>) <description>   → passes if BF-<id> is in manifest.yml.backfills with status: owed
- [ ] <description>                        → bare unchecked - fails compass check
- [x] <description>                        → human ticked - passes
```

`compass check` parses each line under the DoD heading with a regex.

## Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Why considered | Why rejected |
|---|---|---|
| Free-text `EV-A1` anywhere on line | Minimal typing | False-positive risk on prose mentioning evidence ids |
| Markdown footnote `[^EV-A1]` | Familiar syntax | Visually noisy; some renderers mangle footnotes |
| Separate JSON sidecar mapping line → evidence | Decouples content from structure | Asks humans to maintain a parallel structure |

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- DoD clearance is mechanical: `compass check` can verify it without human interpretation.
- G4 (evidence, not assertion) is enforced at the DoD level.
- Backfill deferral is explicit and typed, not a narrative workaround.

**Negative:**
- Learning curve: contributors must learn the `(evidence: ...)` syntax.
- The `templates/verification-report.md` must be updated to teach the syntax.

**Neutral / follow-on:**
- Mistyped tags fail loudly, which is the desired behaviour.
