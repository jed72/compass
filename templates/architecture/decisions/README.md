# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

Each ADR captures one significant architectural decision: its context, the
choice made, the alternatives considered, and the consequences.

## Why ADRs

Architectural decisions tend to be made once and then forgotten.  Six months
later, a new team member asks "why do we do it this way?" and no one remembers.
ADRs make the *why* a first-class, searchable artifact.  They also give the
architect-lens a corpus to cite rather than re-litigating decisions that were
already made deliberately.

## Numbering

ADRs are numbered sequentially (`ADR-001`, `ADR-002`, ...).  Use
`compass adr new <slug>` to create the next ADR - it counts the existing
`ADR-*.md` files, assigns `N+1`, and registers the new file in this README.

**Concurrency note:** if two worktrees both call `compass adr new` at the same
time they may each produce an `ADR-NNN` with the same number.  This surfaces
as a normal git merge conflict on this README at integration.  The orchestrator
resolves it by renumbering one side.  This is deliberate - sequential numbers
matter more than collision-freedom (see ADR-001 for the decision).

## Supersession

When a decision is reversed or replaced:

1. Update the old ADR: set `status: superseded` and `superseded_by: ADR-NNN`.
2. Create the new ADR with `supersedes: ADR-MMM` in its frontmatter.

The chain is navigable: `superseded_by` and `supersedes` form a linked list.
