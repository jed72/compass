# Service Relations

<!-- HOW ASSESS USES THIS FILE
     Assess reads this file and includes it in architecture-loaded.yml as a
     narrative artifact.  The `architect` agent reads it to determine
     which labels in the manifest map to known service names, so it
     knows when to fire automatically as acceptance criteria are defined
     (the scenario that added automatic triggering, `TRC-B2`, is in another
     issue's own record).

     Format: keep service names consistent with the labels you use in the
     manifest (the `labels:` field) so the agent can match them.
-->

## Service map

<!-- List every service / application / external dependency this context
     interacts with.  One row per relation.  Direction: A -> B means A calls B
     (A is the caller, B is the callee).
-->

| From | To | Protocol | Purpose | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <!-- name --> | <!-- name --> | <!-- HTTP / gRPC / event / DB / etc. --> | <!-- one line --> | <!-- high / medium / low --> |

## Ownership

<!-- Cross-reference to ownership.md when the caller and callee have
     different owners - those relations are highest-risk for architectural
     drift. -->

## Known interface contracts

<!-- List any stable contracts (OpenAPI specs, proto files, event schemas)
     that this service publishes or consumes.  Changing a contract must
     create or update an ADR. -->

| Contract | Location | Owned by |
|---|---|---|
| <!-- name --> | <!-- path or URL --> | <!-- team / person --> |

## Prohibited relations

<!-- Relations that must NEVER be created - typically because they would
     create a cycle, violate ownership, or cross a data-classification
     boundary.  These can also live in architecture/invariants.yml, an
     optional freeform YAML file the assess stage already reads into
     architecture-loaded.yml. -->

- <!-- example: service-A must not call service-B directly (use the event bus) -->
