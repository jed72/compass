TEMPLATE: bug-report.md
Produced by: triage, when the issue type is a bug fix (or by whoever reports
             the defect - the reporter's words are the best evidence).
Lives at:    .compass/work/<task-slug>/bug-report.md
Role in the pipeline: the intake artifact for a bug fix. The failing
reproduction test is written from this before any fix; the report is what
the reproduction is checked against. Keep it short and observational -
diagnosis belongs to the fix, not the report.
