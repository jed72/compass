# /compass:status

Report the state of Compass work on disk. Read-only - this changes nothing.

**Scope:** $ARGUMENTS - if an issue slug is given, drill into just that
issue; if empty, render the board across every issue under `.compass/work/`.

`/compass:status` answers *"what should I look at?"*. For the managed
cross-issue view - triage, blockers, owed-follow-up aggregation, and the
periodic digest - use `/compass:flow`.

## What this command is for

Someone asking for status wants what they would get from glancing at a
physical board: what is blocked, what is moving, what is next, what is done.
In plain English, in a few lines, with detail available if they ask.

They do **not** want a per-issue dump of delivery approaches, stages, gate
fractions and artifact codes. Those are Compass's internal vocabulary;
making the reader decode them to find their own work inverts what the
command is for.

So: **the board is the default. Everything else is drill-down.**

## Procedure - no argument (the board)

1. **Read the issues.** List `.compass/work/*/`; `task.yml` is each issue's
   spine. Prefer one scripted pass over per-issue tool calls - a mature repo
   may hold hundreds, and the reader is waiting.

2. **Place each issue in exactly one column**, most urgent first:

   | column | means |
   |---|---|
   | **BLOCKED** | cannot progress without a decision or an unpaid debt being settled: `compass check` fails, an owed follow-up, a missing human approval on an irreversible change |
   | **READY TO SHIP** | all gates green and `compass check` passes, but not yet marked shipped - finished work nobody has closed |
   | **IN PROGRESS** | started, not finished: a `status: active` issue, or artifacts present without a terminal status |
   | **NEXT UP** | explicitly queued to start. If the status vocabulary has no queued state, say so plainly rather than guessing - see step 4 |
   | **DONE** | any terminal status (`landed`, `landed-direct`, `superseded`, `concluded`) |

3. **Write each column as prose, not a table.** Name the issue and say *why
   it is in that column* - the reason is the useful part. Two or three
   sentences per column. Where a column has many members, name the ones
   needing a decision and give a count for the rest.

   For **DONE**, a count is almost always enough. Nobody scans finished
   work.

4. **Account for what cannot be placed.** An issue with no `task.yml`, or no
   `status:` field, cannot honestly go in any column. Report the count on
   its own line. Do not quietly drop it and do not guess: a board that
   silently omits part of the work looks complete when it is not.

5. **Lead with anything blocking a ship**, and keep the whole thing to one
   screen. If the reader wants the delivery approach, stage, gates or
   evidence they will ask - or run `/compass:status <task-slug>`.

### Shape of a good answer

```
BLOCKED (2)
  gcp-internal-test-env-apply owes BF-POSTAPPLY, and it is the terraform-apply
  issue, so it needs a human sign-off to move. address-comprehensive-review's
  follow-up is actually done - recorded as `paid: true` where the check wants
  `status: paid`, so it is a one-word fix rather than real work.

READY TO SHIP (1)
  pypsa-api-v020-extensions - all six gates green, check passes. Just needs
  its status flipped.

IN PROGRESS (5)
  import-coordinate-crs-normalisation is furthest along (criteria defined and
  designed, not verified). The other four are barely started.

NEXT UP
  Nothing is marked as queued - Compass has no state for it, so this cannot
  be answered from disk.

DONE 131 shipped. 94 more issues have no recorded state at all.
```

That is the whole report. It fits on a screen, every line supports a
decision, and no Compass vocabulary leaks into it beyond issue names.

## Procedure - with an issue slug (drill-down)

Here the internals *are* the point. Report:

- **Delivery approach** - from `delivery-approach.md` / `task.yml`: the
  nearest reference shape, the four assessment dimensions, and any policy
  rule that fired.
- **Stage** - inferred from which artifacts exist: `delivery-approach.md`
  -> triaged; `acceptance-criteria.md` -> criteria defined;
  `requirements-review.md` -> requirements reviewed; `design.md` ->
  designed; `distribution-map.md` -> broken down;
  `verification-report.md` -> verified. Cross-check the approach's
  de-scope ledger so a *collapsed* stage is not reported as *missing*.
- **Gates** - from `verification-report.md` and `task.yml`'s `gates:`. Run
  `compass check --issue <slug>` for the mechanical view (read-only).
  **Say when a check passes vacuously.** "no changed_files recorded yet"
  and "0/N pass gates" are green lines that assert nothing; reading them as
  progress is how an issue ships untraced.
- **Owed follow-ups** - scan `delivery-approach.md`'s de-scope ledger and
  the approach's standing obligations. Flag loudly:
  - an unsettled **hotfix follow-up** (the approach record not completed,
    reproduction test not promoted to a scenario, no root-cause devlog
    line);
  - an **unbacked marketing claim** - a claim in `positioning.md` with no
    passing scenario behind it;
  - any de-scoped artifact still marked owed.

## Note

If `delivery-approach.md` is missing for a directory under `work/`, that
issue was started without triage - flag it as a guardrail violation, not
merely an incomplete issue. On the board, that belongs in BLOCKED.
