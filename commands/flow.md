# /compass:flow

`/compass:status` looks *down* into one issue. `/compass:flow` looks
*across* every issue - it is the delivery-management function as a
capability, not a persona. Anyone can run it; it is not a role entry point.

Compass is issue-centric by design: each issue carries its own delivery
approach, artifacts, and gates. But a team runs many issues at once, and
nothing in the per-issue pipeline answers "what is the state of
*everything*, and what needs a human's attention first?" That is this
command.

**Mode:** $ARGUMENTS - default is the live flow board; `--digest` writes a
dated digest file (see below).

## Setup

- Load the `flow-management` skill - it carries the triage heuristics, the
  blocker protocol, and the digest format.
- This command reads broadly and writes only the digest. It never edits an
  issue's artifacts - issue state is inferred from artifacts on disk, never
  set by a label.

## Procedure

1. **Enumerate.** List every issue directory under `.compass/work/`. For
   each, read `delivery-approach.md`, `manifest.yml` (the machine-readable
   manifest), and whichever stage artifacts exist. To report an issue's
   *mechanical* gate status you may run `compass check --issue <slug>` - it
   is read-only and changes nothing.

2. **Assess each issue.** Apply the `flow-management` heuristics:
   - **No `delivery-approach.md`** -> a guardrail violation (work started
     without triage). Surface this above everything else.
   - **Stalled** -> an in-progress stage with no `devlog.md` movement for
     longer than the approach's expected cadence. Flag it and name the
     likely blocker.
   - **Approach outgrown** -> signs in the devlog that the issue no longer
     fits its delivery approach. Recommend `/compass:assess --reassess`.
   - **Healthy** -> progressing in line with its approach.

3. **Build the board.** Group every issue by pipeline stage: triaged ·
   defining criteria · reviewing requirements · designing · implementing ·
   verifying · shipping · shipped. One line per issue: slug · approach ·
   stage · health · owner.

4. **Surface blockers.** For every blocked or stalled issue, state what it
   is blocked on and who or what can unblock it. Anything needing a human
   decision goes to the top.

5. **Aggregate owed follow-ups.** `/compass:status` flags follow-ups per
   issue; `/compass:flow` collects them all into one list - every unsettled
   hotfix follow-up, every unbacked marketing claim, every de-scoped
   artifact still owed, across all issues.

6. **Read the retrospective signal.** Run `compass retro` - it reads
   the `reassessments:` log across every issue and reports whether triage
   is systematically over- or under-sizing the process (a run of "up"
   re-assessments means triage keeps reading work lighter than it is).
   This is the framework's own feedback loop: a framework about
   right-sizing process has to be able to tell whether the right-sizing is
   any good. Surface the signal; if it leans, the fix is in
   `governance/routing-policy.yml` or the triage rubric, not in any one
   issue.

7. **Run rework-scan.** Run `compass rework-scan --format markdown` and
   embed the output in the report as a "Rework scan" section. This surfaces
   cross-issue add-then-delete patterns within the configured window
   (`governance/signals.yml rework_scan.window_days`). The scan is a
   signal - it never gates, never modifies issue state, and always exits 0
   on detection (Flow advises, never gates). If the section is empty,
   record "0 rework instances detected" to confirm the scan ran.

8. **Report**, ordering by what needs attention first: human decisions ->
   guardrail violations -> blockers -> owed follow-ups -> rework signals ->
   retrospective signal -> healthy in-flight -> shipped.

## `--digest`

With `--digest`, also write a dated digest to
`.compass/flow/digest-{{DATE}}.md` using the format in the
`flow-management` skill: shipped since the last digest, in flight, blocked,
owed follow-ups, rework signals, and next up. The digest is the artifact a
team reviews on a cadence - and `/compass:flow --digest` is a natural fit
for a scheduled run (e.g. weekly). It is append-only history: never
overwrite a prior digest.

The digest must include a **Rework scan** section produced by
`compass rework-scan --format markdown`. This section is informational - it
does not change any issue's state, and a non-empty rework report does not
block or gate anything.

## Note

`/compass:flow` advises; it does not gate. The gates live in the per-issue
pipeline where the evidence is. Flow's job is to make sure no issue is
quietly stuck, off-approach, or sitting on an unpaid debt - not to add
another gate.
