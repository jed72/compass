# /compass:refine

Refine is the requirements review: it hardens the spec before any design is
built on it. It resolves ambiguities and QAs `acceptance-criteria.md` against
itself and against `governance/` - the guardrails and strategies.

## First: is the requirements review in play?

Read `delivery-approach.md`. The review is **collapsed on a quick fix** (the
single scenario was certified unambiguous when it was defined), **collapsed
on a hotfix** (the reproduction *is* the clarification), and **skipped on a
spike** (there is nothing to QA - the behaviour is the unknown). If
`delivery-approach.md` collapsed or skipped it, stop - say so, confirm the
de-scope reason still holds, and point the user to `/compass:design`. Do not
re-add a stage the approach skipped, and do not skip one it kept.

On a collapsed- or skipped-review approach the **Definition of Ready** is
satisfied by construction - a quick fix by triage certifying the single
scenario unambiguous, a hotfix by the reproduction test being the spec, a
spike by having no acceptance criteria to be ready against - so there is no
separate checklist to fill. On feature and initiative work it is the
explicit gate below.

On a feature, the review is a light-to-full pass - light, never absent. On an
initiative it is a full pass with an explicit ambiguity ledger and
non-engineering role review.

## What the define stage already did - and what is left for you

The spec-author ran a four-scan self-review inline at the end of the define
stage, before handing the spec over: a **placeholder** scan, an
**orphan**-intent scan, an **untestable**-`Then` scan, and an
**ambiguous**-quantifier scan. Those findings were fixed in place by whoever
made them. It runs on every approach, including a quick fix.

**Refine does not repeat them.** Re-running four mechanical scans over a file
someone has just scanned spends a stage to find nothing. If you do hit one
still outstanding, that means the self-review was skipped - say so, then fix
it; do not quietly absorb it as your own work.

What is left for you is everything the author could not settle alone:

- **Contradictions** between scenarios that cannot both hold.
- **Gaps** across the whole set - a stated outcome, or a `prd.md` success
  signal, with no scenario.
- **Governance conflicts** - a scenario that crosses a guardrail, or departs
  from an applicable strategy with no recorded reason.
- **Ambiguities that need a decision** rather than a correction, each
  recorded in `requirements-review.md` with its resolution and who made it.

The dividing line is who can close the finding. An unfilled placeholder has
one correct answer and the author already knows it. "Which of these two
scenarios is wrong?" does not, and that is what a stage with a reviewer in it
is for. The same split is written from the other side in
`skills/bdd-specification/SKILL.md`.

## Setup

- Load `bdd-specification`; the `spec-author` agent owns this continuation.
- Read `governance/` - the spec is QA'd against the guardrails and the
  applicable strategies here.
- If a non-engineering role is in play, this is where they review: invoke
  `product-lens` (intent fidelity against `prd.md`) and/or `marketing-lens`
  (every planned claim has a candidate scenario).

## Procedure

1. **Self-QA the spec.** Contradictory scenarios? Undefined terms? Edges
   named but not specified? Failure modes missing?
2. **Governance QA.** Does the spec hold the guardrails (especially
   acceptance-before-code and traceability) and respect the applicable
   strategies, including the voice strategies where claims are involved?
3. **Resolve.** For each ambiguity, either resolve it (update
   `acceptance-criteria.md`) or record it as an open question with an owner.
   An unresolved ambiguity is not allowed to silently pass into design.
4. **Write `requirements-review.md`** from
   `templates/requirements-review.md`: the ambiguity ledger, each entry
   resolved or assigned.

## Reassessment trigger

If the review reveals the spec is bigger or more ambiguous than the
assessment assumed, **stop and re-assess** (`/compass:triage --reassess`) - do
not push a feature-shaped process through an initiative-shaped problem.

## Hand-off

Close the review by handing the ambiguity ledger to a human. This is the last
review before work is designed against the spec, so the questions here are
about decisions, not wording.

> I have written the ambiguity ledger to
> `.compass/work/<task-slug>/requirements-review.md`, and updated
> `acceptance-criteria.md` where a resolution changed it.
>
> N ambiguities were found and resolved. The ones that changed what gets
> built are: <short list>.
>
> Worth a read before design. Specifically, look for:
> - **Decisions you disagree with** - each entry records what was decided and
>   by whom; a resolution recorded is not the same as a resolution you would
>   make.
> - **Resolutions that quietly widened scope** - a question answered by
>   adding work should be visible as such.
> - **The Definition of Ready** - every box is checked, and each one is meant
>   to be true rather than ticked.
>
> On approval this goes to the design stage, which turns the spec into a
> technical approach and runs the governance check against it.

## Voice

The ambiguity ledger is read by the person who has to decide, not filled
into a form. Say what was unclear, the call, and why - never a bare
label-and-status row. See `skills/compass-runtime/writing-voice.md`.

## Gate

`requirements-review.md` exists; every ambiguity is resolved or owned; the
spec passes governance QA; and the **Definition of Ready** checklist at the
foot of `requirements-review.md` is fully checked - that is the entry gate
into design, and an unchecked box stops design from starting. Log to
`devlog.md`. Next: `/compass:design`.
