# --- command: next -----------------------------------------------------------
# `compass next` reads manifest.yml + delivery-approach.md and prints ONE
# line: the next stage, the next uncleared gate, and delivery-approach-aware
# collapsed-stage markers. It is strictly READ-ONLY over
# .compass/work/<task>/ - no file is written or created. It derives its
# answer from manifest.yml + delivery-approach.md only; nothing else is read.
#
# Output format (chosen to read clearly without colour escapes):
#   "<NextPhase> [gate: <gate-id>][ | <phase> collapsed on this route]"
# When all stages are complete / landed:
#   "all phases complete"
# When delivery-approach.md is missing:
#   exit non-zero with a message naming delivery-approach.md
# When manifest.yml is missing (assess has not run):
#   exit non-zero with a message naming assess
#
# The canonical stage order Compass follows:
# The current keys. `normalize_spine` maps a retired key forward on load, so a
# list written in the retired spelling would stop matching every manifest it
# reads, and `compass next` would report the wrong stage instead of failing.
