# core.normalize_spine) and the artifact filenames (the map below, which
# moved here from the runtime resolver when the repository's own archive
# migrated - the runtime resolves v2 names only; this module is what reads
# old trees). The user-facing `compass migrate` verb in its own slice wraps
# migrate_tree with dry-run and reporting; the internal verb exists so this
# repository could migrate itself as the first fixture.
