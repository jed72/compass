# compass - a failure observed first
# =============================================================================
# A green record shows the suite passes; it does not show that a test ever
# failed. `suite-passed`, the check behind "tested before it lands"
# (guardrail `G1`), accepted any green, and an unbound green needs no red. So
# an issue could pass it having never seen a failure: 9 of 110 archived
# issues did, as the issue `unbound-green-needs-no-red` measured. This module
# holds the one extra condition `suite-passed` now applies.
#
# Kept apart from checks.py, which is near its line cap.
#
# It also gives the one verdict on an issue's red records that the pre-tool
# hook and `suite-passed` both use, so the two cannot disagree about what
# counts as a red.
#
# DEPENDENCY: standard library (datetime, hashlib, json, os, stat) and
# compass_pkg.core for the config reader. tdd.py imports from here, so this
# module must not import tdd.py.
