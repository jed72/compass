# --- command: bdd extract ----------------------------------------------------
# Lifts the Gherkin out of an issue's acceptance-criteria.md into a plain
# .feature file a real BDD runner (pytest-bdd, cucumber-js, behave, godog) can
# execute. This is what turns the scenario-to-test link from a convention an
# engineer maintains into a fact a runner establishes.

# A Compass scenario in acceptance-criteria.md always looks like this:
#
#   ### Scenario: <title>
#   <!-- traceability id: TRC-A1 · serves: INT-1 -->
#
#   ```gherkin
#   Scenario: <title>
#     Given ...
#   ```
#
# THE ANCHOR IS THE TRACEABILITY COMMENT, NOT THE FENCE. Compass documents
# contain illustrative Gherkin that is not an acceptance criterion (a proposal
# showing what a scenario looks like, this very comment block). Extracting every
# ```gherkin fence would turn those illustrations into scenarios. Requiring the
# traceability comment means only real, id-carrying scenarios are extracted.
# Accept any uppercase id prefix. The template uses TRC- and the examples
# under examples/ use SCN-, and accepting only one would reject a valid
# document with a message that blames the document.
