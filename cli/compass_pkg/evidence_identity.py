    `gate-evidence-present` checks that the path resolves, not that the file
    is the run the entry was made for. Without this check, a record replaced
    after it was cited leaves every check green.

    Two stamps, two different failures:
      record_id      - unique per write. A different one means the file is a
                       different record under the same name.
      content_digest - over the payload. A matching record_id with a different
                       digest means this record was edited in place.

    A record written before stamping existed carries neither. That is
    UNVERIFIABLE, not a pass and not a failure: an unstamped record cannot be
    checked against its citation, and calling it checked would be a check that
    cannot fail. Where nothing in the issue is stamped, the whole check returns
    NOTHING_TO_CHECK so it is counted apart from the passes rather than
    inflating them.
