"""`compass init` - make a directory a Compass project.

Before this verb, nothing owned initialisation. `/compass:init` created
`.compass/config.yml` and `.compass/work/` at steps 4 and 5 of a governance
conversation, `/compass:assess` created `.compass/work/<slug>/` as a side
effect of writing an issue spine, and four of the five role entry points wrote
into `.compass/work/<slug>/` while assuming somebody else had made it. A
project became a Compass project by accident, which meant nothing could check
that it had.

The split this verb keeps:

  compass init      creates .compass/. Nothing else. Safe to run twice, which
                    is what lets the entry-point commands call it
                    unconditionally rather than each testing for the directory.
  /compass:init     the slash command - calls this, then offers the governance
                    conversation that copies governance/ into the project.

Auto-initialisation must never adopt governance. Being initialised for you is
small and reversible; having a governance directory copied into your
repository because you ran /compass:intent is not, and it would arrive without
the conversation that is the whole point of adopting it.

DEPENDENCY: none beyond the standard library and this package. It runs before
a project exists, so it must not reach for anything that assumes one - in
particular not core.find_compass_dir(), which raises when there is no
.compass/ and is exactly the case this verb handles.
