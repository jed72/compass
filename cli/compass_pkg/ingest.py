# compass - reading an existing brief into an issue
# =============================================================================
# Most teams arriving at Compass already have a brief somewhere - Notion, Jira,
# a Google Doc, a file called anything at all. Until this existed, the only way
# in was to open it, read it, and retype it through the intake stage, which is
# transcription and so the kind of step people skip.
#
# THIS MODULE IS THE MECHANICAL HALF, AND ONLY THAT. Resolving a source,
# refusing a scheme, following a redirect, hashing what arrived - the same
# input gives the same answer every time, so it belongs here where it can be
# tested without a person and without a network.
#
# Turning the document into intent.md is JUDGEMENT and lives in a skill:
# deciding that a paragraph about "who this is for" belongs under Users, and
# noticing that no non-goals are stated so a question needs asking. Nothing in
# this module writes intent.md. See technical-design.md DD-1.
#
# DEPENDENCY: `urllib.request` is standard library, so nothing joins the
# dependency set and ADR-013 (vendored third-party code) is not in play. What
# is new is that Compass makes an outbound request at all - it had made none,
# anywhere, before this. That is why the scheme rule below is enforced twice.
