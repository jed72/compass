# `compass analyze` - cross-artifact consistency check
#
# Reads an issue's artifacts (intent.md, acceptance-criteria.md,
# delivery-approach.md, manifest.yml, positioning.md if present) and emits a
# structured consistency report.
#
# Finding types (the taxonomy is fixed in code, not read from signals.yml):
#   orphaned-intent  - a scenario in acceptance-criteria.md/manifest.yml links
#                      to an intent id that does not appear in intent.md
#   route-disagreement - delivery-approach.md and manifest.yml describe
#                        different stage weights for the same stage
#   orphan-claim     - positioning.md lists a claim id that no scenario links to
#   missing-artifact - an artifact needed by the delivery approach's
#                      non-collapsed stage is absent (delivery-approach-aware:
#                      legitimately omitted artifacts on collapsed/skipped
#                      stages are not flagged)
#
# Mode selection (ADR-007):
#   Gate-clearing mode  - verify.analyze is in manifest.yml.gates:
#       exits non-zero on any finding; evidence type `consistency-check`;
#       id prefix `EV-ANALYZE-<task>-<ts>`
#   Advisory mode - verify.analyze NOT in gates:
#       exits 0 even on findings; evidence type `command-output`;
#       id prefix `EV-ANALYZE-ADVISORY-<task>-<ts>`
#
# Invariants honoured:
#   read-only over the manifest, never writing to its `assessment` or
#   `gates` (`Inv-1`, `Inv-4`)
#   the finding taxonomy is structural, not read from signals.yml (`Inv-7`)
#   no intent.md / acceptance-criteria.md exits 0, "no artifacts" (`Inv-8`)
#   never asserts whether gate evidence exists or passes; that is
#   `compass check`'s job
