"""Resolving a scenario's declared test ids against the tree.

A scenario names the test(s) that exercise it, and two questions follow from
that name: does the test exist, and does it actually run. Both are answered by
reading the file rather than by asking a test runner - Compass ships to
projects using pytest, jest, go test and cargo, and a per-runner adapter is
far more surface than the problem needs.

Split out of checks.py when that module passed its size cap; these two
functions are one job and were the natural seam.

    Two id shapes have to work, and the original handled only the first.

    A flat id names the test directly. A NESTED id - jest's

    only its final segment is the test's own name. The chain as a whole is
    never written anywhere, so searching for it verbatim could not succeed on
    any correctly-declared id.

    Word boundaries are applied only on an end where they can be satisfied.
    `\\b` after a name ending in `@`, `)` or `.` requires a word character
    next, so such ids were unresolvable whatever was on disk. Dropping the
    boundaries entirely would be the opposite error - `test_plain` would match
    `test_plain_name`, letting a truncated or misspelled id pass - so each end
