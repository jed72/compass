# The policy states, as a number, how many parallel subtasks each shape
# permits, so a cap can be compared against it directly. A null ceiling
# means UNBOUNDED, not that the number is unknown.
# Nothing in routing-policy.yml or .compass/config.yml states a multiagent width -
# the only cap the policy carries is RP-CAP-001's max_worktrees: 1, and the
# config file says in as many words that the worktree cap is a routing
# concern it does not hold. A ceiling on multiagent work can only come from a
# cap, or from the distribution map at breakdown.
# Route shapes declare `subtask_ceiling` as a number since ADR-023; `core`
# keeps its own copy for reading archived manifests, which still carry the
# words.
