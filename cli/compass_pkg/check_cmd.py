# compass - the Compass CLI
# =============================================================================
# The deterministic half of Compass. The Needle (an LLM or a human) produces
# the four-dimension *readings* - that is judgement, and judgement is the
# adaptivity. Everything downstream of the readings is mechanical, and this is
# where the mechanism lives:
#
#   compass route evaluate   Apply governance/routing-policy.yml to a task's
#                            readings -> the final route, deterministically.
#                            Same readings + same policy => same route, always.
#   compass check            Run the governance/guardrails.yml checks against a
#                            task's manifest.yml + evidence/. The checkable backbone
#                            of the Verify gate.
#   compass tdd-red CMD...    Run a test command, assert it FAILS, record the
#                            red + the .red marker (honestly - the marker is
#                            only written after a real failure).
#                            --scenario TRC-xxx binds the red to a scenario, so
#                            it proves relevance, not just that something broke.
#   compass tdd-green CMD...  Run a test command, assert it PASSES, record the
#                            green, clear the .red marker.
#                            --scenario binds the green the same way.
#                            THE BINDING DECIDES THE FILENAME: a bound run
#                            writes evidence/green-<scenario>.json, an unbound
#                            one writes evidence/green.json, and only that file
#                            is written - so recording one scenario cannot
#                            destroy a record another gate is citing.
#   compass policy lint       Structurally validate routing-policy.yml and
#                            guardrails.yml - including that every guardrail's
#                            declared check is actually implemented in the CLI.
#   compass task lint [F]     Structurally validate a manifest.yml.
#   compass calibration       The Needle's feedback loop - aggregate the
#                            re-frame log across all tasks and report whether
#                            routing is systematically over- or under-sizing.
#   compass ci               The full mechanical gate suite (policy lint +
#                            task lint + check for every task) - for CI.
#
# DEPENDENCY: PyYAML, bundled at cli/vendor/yaml/ and pinned in
# THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md. It is resolved by compass_pkg/__init__.py and is
# the only third-party code Compass ships; everything else is the Python 3
# standard library.
#
# GOVERNANCE RESOLUTION: the CLI looks for a project-local `governance/`
# (walking up from the working directory); if there is none, it falls back to
# the framework's shipped `governance/` next to this script. That fallback is
# the "gradient, not threshold" rule in code - the defaults work with zero
# project setup.

# --- dependency check --------------------------------------------------------
# compass_pkg/__init__.py already verified the bundled copy resolves - or
# exited 3 with a clear message naming the absolute path it checked - before
# this module's own code ever runs (DD-2 of zero-friction-install). By the
# time this line runs, `yaml` is already imported and cached, so this is
# never anything but a normal import.

import re as _re


# --- command: rework-scan ---------------------------------------------------
# Cross-task rework scanner (R4). Reads every manifest.yml under --root (default:
# .compass/work/) and detects add-then-delete patterns within the configured
# window. Output is Markdown (default) or JSON (--format json). This is a
# SIGNAL, not a gate - exit code is always 0 unless the scan itself errors.
# Patterns are loaded from governance/signals.yml at runtime, never hardcoded.
# Suitable for piping into .compass/flow/rework-<date>.md.
#
# Detection modes:
#   1. Simple add-then-delete: file added by task A, deleted by task B within
#      window_days.
#   2. Public-surface churn: the path matches a public_surface_patterns regex
#      AND the same file is added then deleted.
#   3. Migration pair: a file matching migration_paths (glob) is added in task
#      A, and a semantically paired drop migration is added in task B within
#      window_days.
#
# Architectural invariant: Inv-4 (Flow advises, never gates). This command is
# read-only over the task directory tree; it writes nothing.
