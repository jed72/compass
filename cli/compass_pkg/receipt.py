# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains the project's Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

Each ADR captures one significant architectural decision: its context, the
choice made, the alternatives considered, and the consequences.

## Numbering

ADRs are numbered sequentially.  `compass adr new <slug>` assigns the next
available number so the index is always in creation order.  When two worktrees
create ADRs concurrently, a git merge conflict on this README signals the
collision; resolve by renumbering one side.
