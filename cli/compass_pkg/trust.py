# compass - the contribution trust decision
# =============================================================================
# DEPENDENCY: PyYAML, bundled at cli/vendor/yaml/ and pinned in
# THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md. It is resolved by compass_pkg/__init__.py and is
# the only third-party code Compass ships; everything else is the Python 3
# standard library. THIS module uses none of it - json and os only, which is
# deliberate: the fewer things it touches, the easier it is to check that it
# touches nothing the contribution being judged could have written.

"""Is the contribution this process is checking a trusted one?

A project guardrail may declare a command, and `compass check` runs it. That is
useful on a maintainer's branch and dangerous on a contribution nobody has
reviewed, so the command runs only when this module says the contribution is
not untrusted.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS ALLOWED TO READ, AND WHY IT MATTERS.
The answer has to rest on something the contribution cannot forge. Everything
inside the repository checkout can be edited by the pull request being judged -
and on a GitHub `pull_request` event that includes the workflow file itself,
because the workflow runs from the pull request's own merge ref. So a value
passed through a workflow `env:` block is repository-controlled and useless
here, as is any project configuration file.

This module therefore reads only state the CI runner owns:

  * the process environment, and
  * the event payload at the path `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` names, which the runner
    writes outside the checkout.

It reads nothing inside the project root, imports no project configuration, and
never calls find_compass_dir(). That is the property that makes the refusal a
boundary rather than a preference, and tests/test_project_command_boundary.py
enforces it.

    Returns (state, reason). `reason` is the sentence a refusal prints, and it
    always names the signal that decided it - a refusal a reader cannot explain
    is one they will switch off.

    THE RULE IS POSITIVE CONFIRMATION, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
    An earlier version asked "has anything told me this is untrusted?" and ran
    the command when nothing had. That is exactly backwards on a
    `pull_request` event, where the workflow file comes from the contribution
    itself: a fork could blank GITHUB_EVENT_NAME and CI, present as a
    developer's laptop, and have its command run. Erasing a signal was easier
    than forging one.

    So a CI run must be positively confirmed as trusted or it refuses. The
    confirmation has to come from the runner's own event payload, which must be
    readable AND outside the checkout - a payload path pointing into the
    repository is something the contribution could have written, and is
    rejected rather than believed.

    `project_root` is passed in rather than resolved here, so this module never
    has to go looking through the repository for anything.
