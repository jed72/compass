"""`landed_by` - an issue whose work was done through a different issue.

Kept apart from `checks.py`, which has a 1200-line cap (`test_trc_a2`). This
block is cohesive: one constant, one reader, one predicate and one check.

DEPENDENCY: none beyond the standard library and this package. It reads a manifest
through `core.load_yaml`, which is where the bundled PyYAML is resolved; nothing
here imports yaml directly. Stated rather than omitted so the dependency scan
covers this file instead of listing it as unmarked.

# =============================================================================
# `landed_by` - an issue whose work was done through a different issue
# =============================================================================
# Use `landed_by:` when the work was delivered through another issue or a
# commit. Marking such an issue `abandoned` misleads `compass retro`, which
# reads the status to judge whether assessment is over- or under-sizing the
# process.
#
# `landed_by:` MOVES the claim; it does not waive it. The named issue must
# exist, must be landed, must carry a record of its own, and must name this
# issue back in `delivered:`. Relaxing a guardrail check is safe only when
# all four conditions are checked.

#: The checks `landed_by` stands down, named rather than derived.
#:
#: Measured: these are exactly the four checks an empty-record landed issue
#: fails. A DERIVED set - "relax whatever fails" - would go wrong the moment
#: a check is added, silently widening the relaxation. A named list fails
#: loudly when the set changes, which is the moment to think about it.
#:
#: What is NOT here is deliberate. `dashboard-current` still applies: the
#: review page must match the manifest whatever the manifest says. `dod-evidence-typed`
#: and `backfills-paid` still apply: an unchecked box or an owed follow-up is
#: this issue's own business regardless of who did the work.
