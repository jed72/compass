# --- living system spec derivation (ADR-008) ---------------------------------
#
# derive_system_spec(project_root) is the internal helper that produces
# docs/system-spec.md by walking every .compass/work/*/manifest.yml whose
# status == 'landed'.
#
# Design constraints honoured here:
#   `Inv-5`  - annotation over per-issue specs, never a parallel spec; the
#            derived file carries the DERIVED FILE header.
#   `Inv-6`  - all derivation inputs live on disk; no in-memory accumulation
#            beyond the walk (reconstructibility).
#   `Inv-8`  - backward compat: manifest.yml files with no `status` field
#            (schema 1.0) are treated as active (not landed), so they are
#            excluded from the derivation.
#   ADR-008 §3 - idempotent; deterministic order (land_timestamp, then
#             issue slug as tiebreaker); supersession (same intent id →
#             latest-landed wins for current section, earlier → archive).
#   ADR-008 §4 - never source-of-truth; DERIVED FILE header on line 1;
#             silent overwrite on next ship.
#   brand-new project with no landed issues produces a stub file.
