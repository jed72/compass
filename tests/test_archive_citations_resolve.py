"""A citation into the issue archive must open.

Compass's whole claim is an audit trail: a document says where its evidence
is, and a reader follows the path. A path that does not resolve is not a weak
citation - it is no citation at all, and it looks exactly like a good one.

This went unnoticed because nothing checked it. The v2 vocabulary freeze
migrated the archive, renaming `spec.feature.md` to `acceptance-criteria.md`
in every issue directory, and left 22 test modules citing the old name in
their provenance line. Each of those reads:

    Spec: .compass/work/<slug>/spec.feature.md (TRC-A1..A3, ...)

and none of them opens. ADR-014 said the archive would never be edited, which
would have avoided this; ADR-020 supersedes that and migrates the archive
deliberately, with this guard as the condition - the cost is paid once,
visibly, rather than accumulating unmeasured.

TWO CHECKS, BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF THEM CAN RUN IN CI. `.compass/work/` is
gitignored, so in a clean checkout those paths cannot resolve no matter how
correct they are. Splitting them keeps real enforcement everywhere:

  * the NAME is checkable anywhere - a citation must not spell a filename this
    framework has retired, and that is what all 22 of the originals got wrong.
  * the PATH is checkable only where the archive exists, so that half skips
    with a stated reason rather than passing on an empty tree.
