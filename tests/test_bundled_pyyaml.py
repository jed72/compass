"""Group G - the bundled copy and the machine it lands on.

TRC-G1: whatever PyYAML the host machine has - none, one, or a different
version - the CLI always resolves the copy Compass ships, deterministically.
TRC-G2: the version that ships is the version the documentation names, and it
is a specific version, not a range. TRC-G3: the bundled library carries its
own licence and its attribution, and Compass's own licence is not altered to
describe code Compass did not write.

This file also carries DD-2's repository fitness test
(`test_every_yaml_reader_resolves_through_the_shared_mechanism`): the static
proof that nobody bypassed the one resolution mechanism. The dynamic tests
above prove the mechanism resolves correctly against a decoy; this proves
nobody wrote a seventh reader the old way. It is a fitness function in the
shape of `tests/test_house_style.py` - it adds no guardrail, no gate, no
vocabulary; `verify.fitness` is what it clears.
"""

# The vocabulary rename landed on 2026-08-25: the assess and plan stages took
# the names their machine keys, skills and agents already used; `design` went
# back to the designer; design.md became technical-design.md and prd.md became
# intent.md. Spines and documents written before still load and resolve
# (ADR-006), so what moved is the CANONICAL spelling these tests assert - not
# what the framework computes. Re-pointed, not relaxed.
