"""The partial-bump guard covers every place a version lives.

This test finds every version string in the published surfaces and asserts
the guard has a case for each, so the list of locations cannot go out of
date.

`tests/test_version_consistency.py` parametrises the locations it checks. It
covered five; there are seven. `cli/compass_pkg/core.py` holds the constant
`cli/compass` asserts equality against, and the smoke-test banner is the one
`docs/releasing.md` calls "the one that gets forgotten, because it lives in
prose rather than in a manifest". Neither was in the list.

Three documents also disagreed about the count: the guard's docstring said
five, `docs/releasing.md` said six, and there were seven.

This is the fourth instance in one release of a check reporting success while
checking nothing - alongside the smoke-test guard that searched for a retired
spelling, an evidence record with no identity, and `OLD_VERSIONS`, which no
code read and which a missing comma had silently corrupted. A check that
cannot fail gives false confidence, which is worse than no check.

Scenario ids: see docs/system-spec.md.
