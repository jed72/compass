"""The retired names are gone at 4.0.0 (issue what-compass-owes-an-unobserved-adopter).

ADR-019 carried redirect stubs and one hidden CLI alias through 3.x, and
scheduled their removal at the next major version. This is that removal.

What goes: the three slash-command stubs, the `design`-for-`plan` verb alias,
and the `terminology.yml` entries that exist only to describe them.

What stays, and why it is not an oversight: the read-side rename tables in
`cli/compass_pkg/core.py` and `analyze.py`. They let an archived manifest and
an old prose record load, which ADR-020 requires - the archive is migrated,
not frozen. They are kept for the archive's sake, not for an adopter's, and
TRC-D3 holds the decision record to saying so.
