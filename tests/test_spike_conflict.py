"""The safety-critical spike-vs-floor routing-conflict cases.

When the candidate delivery approach is spike (goal=exploration) and a
routing-policy floor would raise it to a delivery approach (because the
work touches risky surface), the evaluator must refuse - silent promotion
of a spike into delivery would break the guarantee that exploration cannot
become delivery. The honest output is a routing conflict that needs a
reassessment.
