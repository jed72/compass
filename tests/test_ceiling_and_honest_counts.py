"""Three claims the tool made that it could not support.

Each is the same shape: output that reads as a decision or a verification when
it is neither.

* **Topology at triage.** The evaluator printed `topology: swarm` for work
  with one changed file. It cannot know: it has no concept of a work unit, and
  `routing-policy.yml` contains no reference to units, independence or
  streams. The distribution map that decides parallelism is written at design,
  three stages later. So the evaluator now emits a *ceiling* - how many
  streams this approach permits - and breakdown sets the topology once the map
  exists.

* **The check summary's denominator.** `12 of 15 check(s) passed` reads as
  three failures at a glance. The total is also not a constant: it depends on
  the assessment, because `G5 A human signs off on the irreversible` only
  applies when the work touches auth, payments, personal data or migrations.

* **`suite-passed`'s wording.** It establishes that a green run is on record.
  It does not establish which scenarios that run exercised - `green.json`
  holds one exit code for one command and never enumerates the tests.

Scenario ids: see .compass/work/dry-run-2-rulings/acceptance-criteria.md.
