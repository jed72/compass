"""The plain words come first; the code follows in brackets.

The rule this checks is an extension of the existing ban on bare `G1`-`G5` and
`S1`-`S12` codes, widened to every id prefix and given the one thing that ban
never stated: the ORDER. "a human signs off on the irreversible (G5)" is right;
"G5 fired, which means a human signs off on the irreversible" is not, because
the reader met the code before its meaning.

The check reports and never blocks (TRC-C4). The tests in this file are a
different thing and must be able to fail.

each code means is DERIVED from governance rather than hand-written, and a
derivation that returns empty makes every code meaningless, every count zero
and every test green while nothing has been inspected. That is the exact defect
this issue exists to stop, so the check refuses to report a zero it cannot
stand behind.
