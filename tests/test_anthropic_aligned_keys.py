"""The machine keys renamed to match Anthropic's platform vocabulary.

ADR-023 records the rule: where a term has a counterpart in Anthropic's
platform documentation, Compass uses their word with their meaning. Four
machine names move under it, and each has to keep reading what is already on
disk (ADR-006).

| Was | Is | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `topology` | `orchestration` | their docs split single agent from multiagent |
| `stream_ceiling` | `subtask_ceiling` | they fan out "independent subtasks" |
| `verify.fitness` | `verify.architecture` | printed by `compass check`, so a teaching surface |
| config `swarm:` | config `multiagent:` | the one vocabulary file adopters hand-edit |

The route shapes stop carrying a word at all. `routing.py` was already
converting `solo`/`solo-or-pair`/`swarm` into 1/2/None through a lookup table
and using the number, so the shapes now declare the number and the conversion
goes. The table survives in `core` because archived manifests still carry the
words.
