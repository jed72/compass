"""Slice 8: `compass migrate` - the user-facing wrap around the migration
core the machine-manifest slice proved on this repository's own archive.

Dry-run by default with a human-readable report of what would change;
`--apply` executes; a second apply is a no-op; and the v1-to-v2 mapping
lives in the scan-exempt cli/migrate-map.yml, which the migrator consumes -
so the enforced CLI never carries a v1 spelling in a literal. The 1.x
fixtures are constructed here: nothing current serves as un-migrated
input (the archive migrated at the machine-manifest slice), per the recorded
exception.

# The vocabulary rename landed on 2026-08-25: the assess and plan stages took
# the names their machine keys, skills and agents already used; `design` went
# back to the designer; design.md became technical-design.md and prd.md became
# intent.md. Spines and documents written before still load and resolve
# (ADR-006), so what moved is the CANONICAL spelling these tests assert - not
# what the framework computes. Re-pointed, not relaxed.
