"""`compass issue set-status --reason` leaves the manifest valid (issue
set-status-reason-writes-an-invalid-manifest).

The command wrote `parked_reason` for `parked` and a bare `note` for every
other status. `parked_reason` is declared in `schemas/manifest.schema.json`;
`note` never was, and the schema sets `additionalProperties: false`. So the
flag worked for one status out of five and corrupted the manifest for the
other four - and `compass ci`, which lints every issue on disk, then failed
for the whole repository.

Nothing caught it because the two halves were tested apart: `set-status` has
tests, `issue lint` has tests, and no test set a status with a reason and then
linted the result. The pairing that breaks was the pairing nobody made.
