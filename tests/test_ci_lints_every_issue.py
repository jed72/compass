"""The cross-issue sweep lints every manifest, and its summary says what it did.

`compass ci` lints every manifest, queued ones included, because structure
is checkable at any stage; its summary counts the issues it fully checked.
An issue that has been assessed but not yet defined has no acceptance
criteria yet, which is true of the check and not of the lint - so a
`continue` placed above both `cmd_task_lint` and `cmd_check` let a
not-yet-started issue skip the lint too, and the run still ended:

    compass ci: PASS - governance valid; every issue lints clean and checks green.

against a manifest declaring a schema version this CLI does not handle.

Two consequences:
- a malformed manifest could sit in a repository indefinitely without the
  sweep noticing;
- `status: parked` became a one-word way to leave the sweep while it still
  reported everything clean.

Scenario ids: see docs/system-spec.md.
