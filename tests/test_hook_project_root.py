"""The pre-tool hook finds the project it is enforcing, or refuses.

`PROJECT_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}"` assumed the working directory
is the repository root. When Claude Code is started anywhere else - a
subdirectory, or a parent - the hook looked for `.compass/` in the wrong
place, found nothing, and blocked every code edit while reporting that triage
had not run. It had.

Two failures in one line. The resolution was wrong, and the diagnostic named
a cause that was not the cause, which cost a demo rehearsal a symlink
workaround before anyone questioned the message.

The fix walks up from the working directory, and refuses when it finds
nothing - an enforcement path that cannot tell what it is enforcing must
never wave an edit through. That is the same failure 2.1.0 fixed one layer
down, where a missing vendored library made this hook exit 3 and the runtime
read it as "allow".

Scenario ids: see docs/system-spec.md (group A).
