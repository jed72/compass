"""Shipping does not refuse the framework's own bookkeeping.

`compass ship-commit` refuses to commit paths outside the issue's declared
scope - its `changed_files` plus its artifact directory. The check is
needed: a repo-wide auto-formatter plus a whole-tree re-stage once took a
real index from 23 files to 1,574, including a concurrent agent's
uncommitted work.

`.compass/current-task` sits outside the issue's directory and
`/compass:assess` writes it, so the scope check must allow it by name.

The allowance is a named list, never a prefix: anything under `.compass/`
would re-admit a sibling issue's artifacts into this issue's commit, which
is exactly what the check exists to stop.

Scenario ids: see docs/system-spec.md (group D).
