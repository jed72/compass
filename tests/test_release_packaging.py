"""TRC-F6 - the distributed plugin actually contains the bundled copy.

The working tree is not the artifact. This repository has already shipped a
tarball missing files it contained once (`examples/<x>/.compass/work/` was
silently stripped by a BSD-tar exclude bug) - `scripts/release.sh`'s
examples-integrity check exists because of it. Under bundling, the same class
of miss would turn every install back into the exact "PyYAML required" error
this issue removes, so this test exercises the real selection logic
(`release_file_list()`, sourced unmodified from `scripts/release.sh`) against
a real git index, tars exactly what it selects, unpacks that tarball
somewhere clean, and reaches first triage from there on a genuinely bare
interpreter.

Why a temporary clone rather than this repository's own working tree: the
new vendored files are on disk but not yet part of this repository's git
index (Build leaves the tree uncommitted), and `release_file_list()` selects
from `git ls-files` - the actual selection any real release performs. A
temporary clone with everything this repository currently has on disk
(tracked and not-yet-tracked alike) committed into a fresh index lets the
real, unmodified function answer honestly, rather than a copy of its logic.
