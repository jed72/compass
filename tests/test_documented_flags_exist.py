"""Every flag a shipped document teaches is one the CLI accepts (issue
reframe-is-documented-but-does-not-exist).

`tests/test_documented_commands_exist.py` checks that every documented
`compass <verb>` is a real subcommand. It stops at the verb, so six shipped
surfaces taught `--reframe` - a flag no version of the CLI has ever parsed -
and nothing objected. `commands/assess.md` went further and promised the
spelling was "accepted for one major version".

A reader who follows that gets `unrecognized arguments` and no way to tell
whether the tool or the instruction is wrong.
