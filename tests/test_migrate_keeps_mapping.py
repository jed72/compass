"""The migrator keeps its v1-to-v2 mapping after the stubs are removed.

ADR-014 deletes the deprecation stubs. It deliberately does NOT delete the
translation table `compass migrate` reads, and the distinction is the whole
decision:

  * A **stub** answers a caller who typed the old name. With no adopters, it
    is a promise kept to nobody.
  * A **mapping** reads a file that used the old name. Archives written under
    the v1 vocabulary still exist, and Compass tells people to keep them.

Deleting the second along with the first would strand exactly the historical
records the framework's own pitch is built on.

Spec: .compass/work/rehearsal-cli-defects/acceptance-criteria.md (RCD-F4).
