"""The pre-tool hook enforces the tree the edit is in, not the session's.

Compass creates git worktrees itself at breakdown, so on any multiagent
approach the session directory and the edited file are in different trees.
The hook resolved the project from `$(pwd)` or `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` - both
of which name the session - and so read the wrong `.compass/`.

It failed in both directions:

* **Closed.** A builder who had recorded a red in its worktree was blocked,
  and told "no failing test on record" while a valid `.red` and its evidence
  sat in that worktree's own issue directory.

* **Open.** A red recorded in the MAIN tree unlocked production edits in
  every worktree, including ones whose builder had no failing test at all.
  This is the fail-open the hook's own comment refuses for the parent walk,
  reached by another route, and it appears only on the topology where the
  work is most consequential.

Reproduced on 2026-08-27 before the fix: a valid red placed in the main tree
allowed an append to `cli/compass_pkg/core.py` inside a worktree that had no
red of its own.
