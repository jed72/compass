"""Governance drift detection (task governance-drift-detection).

A project that runs `/compass:init` gets a COPY of `governance/`. The framework
later ships new floors and checks; the copy never learns about them; and nothing
reports the divergence. The result is a route that looks correct, passes every
validator, and is quietly missing gates current policy requires.

Reproduced against HEAD before this was written: a `governance/` missing four
floors and five checks computes 7 gates where the shipped policy computes 9, and
`compass policy lint` returns a clean PASS.

The failure is DIRECTIONAL, which is what makes it dangerous - stale governance
never fails loudly, it produces a *lighter* route. Every artifact looks right.

Two properties matter as much as the detection:

  * It must not cry wolf. A project that reworded a rationale, reordered its
    floors, or added its own rules has not drifted. A detector that fires on
    those gets switched off, and then detects nothing.
  * A deliberate omission must be distinguishable from an unseen one. A project
    that considered RG-FLOOR-006 and rejected it is in a different state from
    one that has never heard of it.

Spec: .compass/work/governance-drift-detection/spec.feature.md (TRC-A1..A3,
      TRC-B1..B8).
