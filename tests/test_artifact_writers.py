"""Where a document is written, and what stays behind.

Scenario group B of `docs-compass-artifacts`.

Two directories, and the split between them is the whole point:

  .compass/work/<slug>/          machine state - the manifest, the evidence
                                 records, the TDD markers, the devlog. Read and
                                 written by the CLI.
  docs/compass/<created>-<slug>/ human documents - the spec, the design, the
                                 review. Written for a person, and now living
                                 where a person browsing the repository finds
                                 them.

The date is the manifest's `created:` field, not the day the document is
written: an issue that sits queued for a fortnight would otherwise scatter its
documents across two directories.
