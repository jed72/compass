"""How the standalone tell check behaves (issue human-voice, TRC-D2, D3, F1, F2).

`scripts/voice-tells.py` greps the three writing-voice tells a fixed string
can find - "I will now proceed", "Upon completion", "utilize" - over an
issue's markdown artifacts. It is advisory: it always exits 0, it is
registered in no `guardrails.yml` entry, and no test here asserts the
repository is free of tells. `tests/test_human_voice.py` asserts what the
prose surfaces carry; this file asserts how the check itself behaves, run as
a subprocess over fixtures in `tmp_path` (design.md DD-4).

Criteria: docs/system-spec.md
Design:   .compass/work/human-voice/design.md, section 5 (the script's
          contract) and DD-2 (what "newly written" scopes to) and DD-3 (why
          a standalone script rather than a CLI verb).
