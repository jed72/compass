"""How archive-quote verification behaves in each environment it runs in
(issue archive-quote-verification).

`skills/compass-runtime/writing-voice.md` quotes the real archive verbatim,
citing a path under `.compass/work/` for every pair. `.compass/work/` is
gitignored, so continuous integration never has it - and the check that used
to compare a quote against its cited file simply skipped whenever the file
was missing, which meant a fabricated or altered quote passed the build
every time continuous integration ran it.

`scripts/verify-archive-quotes.py` closes that gap with a two-part check:
a committed hash manifest (`skills/compass-runtime/archive-quote-manifest.json`)
records, per quoted span, a sha256 of its exact text - a fingerprint, not a
copy - and verification always checks the live quote against that hash. Where
the archive is also present, it additionally checks the quote directly
against the real file. Either mismatch is a hard failure; the only case that
still yields a skip is a hash that matches with no file to compare it
against directly, and that skip must say, by name, which spans went
unverified and that the manifest is what confirmed them.

Every test below builds its own fixture reference text, fixture manifest,
and fixture archive directory in `tmp_path` - never the real repository
files - so TRC-1 in particular proves the archive-absent path can actually
fail, rather than asserting it never gets exercised
(`tests/test_human_voice.py`'s TRC-A2 and TRC-C2 call the same module
against the real files, which is why that file still uses `pytest.skip` when
this developer's own checkout happens to be missing the archive).
