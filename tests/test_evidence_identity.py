"""Evidence has an identity, and a citation is checked against it.

A registry entry is a path pointing at a record file. Nothing connected the two
beyond the path, so replacing the file silently replaced what a gate rested on -
and `compass check` reported PASS throughout. Two landed issues are in that
state.

These tests pin the two stamps written at record time (`record_id`, unique per
write, and `content_digest`, over what was written), the write path that stops
clobbering, and the check that compares them.

Scenario ids trace to .compass/work/tdd-green-unbound-record/
acceptance-criteria.md - group A (the write path), B (identity), C (the check),
D (spines written before stamping existed).
