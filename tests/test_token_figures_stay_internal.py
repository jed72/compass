"""The rehearsal's token figures never reach a tracked file.

The measurements are real, but they are one run of one issue with a
rehearsal's worth of detours in it - diagnosing someone else's broken test
harness, evaluating four alternative repositories, two regression
investigations. They are an upper bound, not a benchmark.

Two reasons they stay internal. A single run is not evidence, and a number
travels away from its caveat: quoting "57.4M tokens" would be true and
badly misleading, because cache reads - the cheapest token class - exceed new
input by roughly 85x. And leading on efficiency undercuts the claim Compass
actually makes, which is that it deliberately does *more* work.

This guard checks the tracked surface, which is what a reader outside this
machine can see. The figures themselves live in `docs/analysis/`, which is
gitignored, so they stay private by construction - and this test keeps
working on a clean clone where those files are absent.

Scenario ids: see docs/system-spec.md (RR-4).
