"""Compass's central artifact has one name, and old-named files still load.

`issue spine` becomes `issue manifest`. The file is `manifest.yml`, its root
key is `issue:`, the path slug is `<issue-slug>`, and the module is
`manifest.py`.

Measured before the change: `spine` appeared 521 times and had no `terms:`
entry, so the most-used noun in the framework was the one word the vocabulary
scan never checked. 26 of those uses glossed it in place - "the
machine-readable issue spine" - which is the sentence you write when you know
the word will not land on its own.

The compatibility path is not new. `cli/migrate-map.yml` already maps retired
filenames forward and `normalize_spine()` already maps retired keys; this adds
a row to each. What must stay true is that a file written under the old name
still loads, because `.compass/work/` is gitignored in this repository and
176 records have no git history behind them.
