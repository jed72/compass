"""Surface hygiene (issue executable-bdd-and-richer-plans).

Two pieces of tidying:

  * `skills/constitution-check/` is removed: it only redirected to
    `governance-check` and nothing loaded it. A dead skill in the plugin's
    skill list costs a reader attention every time they scan it.

  * The define stage's self-review and the requirements review overlap.
    Both files state the split: the self-review is four quick scans; the
    requirements review does the work that needs a decision.
