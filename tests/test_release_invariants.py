#         - 2 check names: no-trusted-rerun, command-passes
#         - 1 evidence-record field: attempts (+rerun_without_change paired)
#         - 1 signal category: design_smell
#   1.5.0 - 1 strategy id: S6 (regression-baseline, from field feedback)
#   2.0.0 - 1 strategy id: S7 (cold-reader prose)
#   next  - 1 strategy id: S8 (voice audition, standing - specialises S7 with
#           a named calibration sample; issue voice-audition-standing)
#         - 1 strategy id: S10 (mutation proof - a guard is accepted on a
#           demonstrated failure, not a passing test; added at 2.1.0)

# gate set, the check set, the evidence types, the signal categories. S7 adds
# none of those - it is assessed under the existing `clarity` review dimension
# and fails nothing. Strategies are the accretive half of the model by design;
# strategies.md opens by calling them "cheap to add, expected to evolve, fine
# to drop". The list below is enumerated so that each addition is a deliberate,
# reviewed act, not to freeze the count.
