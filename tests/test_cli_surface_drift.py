"""Acceptance tests for task cli-surface-drift-v1-2.

The forward-looking move: parse `compass --help` to derive the truth set of
subcommands and assert it appears in the documented CLI blocks. The next new
subcommand that ships without updating the docs fails these tests in CI.

Scenario ids: TRC-A1..C1, from the `cli-surface-drift-v1-2` issue. Its
record is not in this tree - `.compass/work/` has never been tracked in
git, so a path into it was never openable by anyone but the author, and
that directory is gone. The ids and the description above are what
survives.
