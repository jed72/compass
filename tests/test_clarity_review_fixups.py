"""Production-code comments and headers corrected against two clarity
reviews of the prose-breaks-the-writing-style sweep.

`.compass/work/prose-breaks-the-writing-style/evidence/review-clarity-batches-1-4.md`
and `-batches-5-9.md` each read the rewritten prose against the code beside
it and found comments and module headers that state something the code does
not do. This file pins the corrected text so a later rewrite cannot
reintroduce the same contradiction silently.

Findings covered (numbered as the batch 5-9 review numbers them):
  1. `cli/compass_pkg/policy.py` claimed `compass policy lint`, which is
     `governance.py`'s verb.
  2. `cli/compass_pkg/core.py` claimed the delivery-approach evaluator, which
     is `routing.py`'s.
  3. `cli/compass_pkg/receipt.py` said an evidence type with no renderer
     entry "lands as a path-only entry"; the renderer has no path column.
  4. `scripts/release.sh` gave a tar-exclude cause for a hard-fail check that
     no longer exists - the script never passes `--exclude` to tar.
  10. `cli/compass_pkg/terminal.py` attached "under every `add_parser` call"
      to the wrong noun.
  11. `cli/compass_pkg/manifest.py` led a sentence with a bare code, `G1`,
      with no plain word in front of it.
  12. `scripts/multiagent.sh` shipped the reviewing agent's own first-person
      uncertainty in a comment with no owner.
  14. `cli/compass_pkg/calibration.py` used three names for one thing across
      three lines; two matched the CLI's printed output, one did not.
