"""CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md tell a session to write plain English.

Nothing mechanical reads a conversation, so what is checked here is the
instruction, not the writing. A session can have this rule in front of it and
still write "low-hanging fruit". These tests establish only that the rule is
where every session in this repository reads it: CLAUDE.md for Claude Code,
AGENTS.md for any other runtime.

Each test reads the "Plain English" section alone, up to the next heading. A
word such as "idiom" appearing somewhere else in the file must not satisfy it.

- PE-1, in docs/compass/2026-09-11-claude-md-plain-english/delivery-approach.md
- PFR-1, in docs/compass/2026-09-11-plain-english-full-rules/delivery-approach.md
