"""Project commands are a trust boundary.

A project guardrail may declare `check: command-passes`, and `compass check`
runs what it declares. These tests pin the two conditions that now sit in front
of that execution, and the safer way to declare the work.

The two conditions are not equal, and the tests keep them unequal:

  * The **trust decision** is read from state the CI runner owns - the process
    environment, and the event payload whose path the environment names. A
    contribution cannot forge it. It is evaluated first.
  * The **opt-in** is read from `.compass/config.yml`, which any contribution
    can edit. It is evaluated second, and only for a contribution that was not
    already refused.

Scenario ids trace to .compass/work/project-commands-are-a-trust-boundary/
acceptance-criteria.md - group A (opt-in), group B (the refusal), group C (the
script form), group E (a disabled guardrail does not go quiet).

# its PASS/FAIL and the reason it gave. That detail moved to --verbose on
# 2026-08-24 when the gate verdict came under the terminal output contract;
# the checks themselves are unchanged. The assertions are re-pointed rather
# than rewritten, because what they assert still holds - only where it is
# printed changed.
