"""Process-impact telemetry (task process-impact-telemetry).

`compass retro --impact` reports lead time, land frequency, change-fail
signal and restore time, attributed to route shape and gate set.

The substance is not the arithmetic. This repository has 20 landed tasks and
ZERO hotfixes, so a naive implementation reports a change-fail rate of 0% -
which reads as excellent stability and means "nobody has filed one yet". That is
this codebase's recurring failure shape in a new costume: a number that looks
like evidence and is silence. Group C forbids it.

Spec: .compass/work/process-impact-telemetry/spec.feature.md (TRC-A1..A4,
      B1..B3, C1, C2, F1..F4).
