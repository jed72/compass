"""The suite means the same thing on a shallow clone as on a full one.

Two tests assert what their own issue did by diffing a pinned commit range.
`actions/checkout` fetches shallow history by default, so those objects are
absent in continuous integration and `git diff` exits 128 - green on every
developer machine, red on the one nobody watches.

The range check may degrade when the history genuinely is not there. What may
not degrade is the content assertion beside it, which needs no history and
carries the invariant that matters now.

Spec: .compass/work/tests-survive-shallow-clone/acceptance-criteria.md (TRC-1).
