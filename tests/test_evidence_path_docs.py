"""Published surfaces describe where a TDD record is actually written.

`compass tdd-green --scenario TRC-x` writes `evidence/green-TRC-x.json`. A run
with no binding writes `evidence/green.json`. Both are real; naming only the
second is what misleads, because the skills tell you to bind.

THE GUARD CHECKS THE CLAIM, NOT THE FILE. The shared path is still exactly what
an unbound run writes, so forbidding it would force the documentation to stop
naming a real thing. The rule is:

    where a text claims a verb WRITES the shared record, the claim must be
    qualified as the unbound case.

**An earlier version checked this per file** - a file naming the shared record
had to mention the bound one somewhere. Mutation MP-1 killed it: once a file
has been corrected it contains the bound form, so the old claim could be
reintroduced anywhere else in that file and the guard stayed green. It was
checking whether the file had ever been fixed, not whether the sentence was
right.

The window is the matching line plus one either side, because this repository's
prose is hard-wrapped and a qualifier routinely lands on the next line.

What it still cannot do: a qualified claim can still describe the behaviour
incorrectly. This catches an unqualified claim, not a wrong one.
