"""A repository that never opted into Compass never hears from it.

Installed at user scope - the default marketplace path - `hooks/pre-tool.sh`
runs in every repository on the machine. In one with no `.compass/` it refused
every Write, Edit and Bash write to a code path, and told the user to start
Claude Code inside the project. Someone trying Compass on one project lost the
ability to edit code in every other one.

`.compass/` is the opt-in, and since `init-is-the-opt-in` only `compass init`
creates it - run by the five entry points, so it appears the moment a user runs
a Compass command deliberately. That is what makes silence safe here: a
repository with no `.compass/` has genuinely never been asked to use Compass.

Fail-closed behaviour inside an opted-in project is unchanged.
