"""The pre-tool hook guards the project it is for, and nothing else.

Reported from the field (GitHub #57, filed against 2.0.0 and reproduced on
3.1.1). `is_enforced_path()` classified a path by extension and glob but never
checked the path was inside the project. The project-relative path is computed
only when the target happens to be under `PROJECT_DIR`; anywhere else `rel`
stayed absolute, and the extension rules fired regardless.

So any `.py`, `.ts` or `.go` file anywhere on the machine was treated as this
project's production code - a scratch file in a session temp directory, a
throwaway script in a detached worktree. Neither can reach `main` by any path.

The friction is not the point. The refusal told the author to write a failing
test or re-run triage as a spike, and for a file outside the project neither
is a coherent action - so the only ways forward were to route around the hook
or abandon the work. A guardrail issuing unactionable instructions teaches
people to look for the bypass, which is the behaviour it exists to prevent.

Scenario ids: see .compass/work/field-feedback-hook-scope-and-restage/
acceptance-criteria.md.
