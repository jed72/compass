"""A manifest the evaluator wrote passes the linter the same CLI ships.

`compass approach evaluate --write` records a re-assessment with `kind` and
`changed` alongside the required fields. `schemas/manifest.schema.json` set
`additionalProperties: false` on that entry and declared neither, so every
honest re-assessment left the issue failing `compass issue lint`.

That punished the behaviour the methodology asks for. Re-assessing is
described as a normal event, and an approach quietly outgrown is the failure
it warns about - so a tool that reddens the build for recording one teaches
people not to record them.

Both keys earn their place: `kind` is what separates a judgement re-assessment
from a scope change in `compass retro`'s re-sizing signal, and `changed` is the
audit detail. The schema was what needed correcting.
