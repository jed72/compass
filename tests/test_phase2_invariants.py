"""Invariants for the phase-2 additions (issue phase-2-skills-check-and-cli-split).

Two skills and one check were added. The properties that must survive that:
a project which opted into nothing sees no change, every issue already on disk
returns what it returned before, and the framework grew by artifacts and checks
only - no guardrail, gate, assessment dimension, or top-level CLI verb.

Spec: phase-2-skills-check-and-cli-split/acceptance-criteria.md (`TRC-F1`..`TRC-F3`).
