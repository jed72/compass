"""The mechanical half of the writing-style rewrite, enforced.

The writing-style audit records 2,928 findings across 474 files against the
standard in the maintainer's global `CLAUDE.md`. It is not itself part of
this repository's tracked tree - it lives under `docs/analysis/`, which is
gitignored, so it opens on the maintainer's machine and nowhere else. Nine
batches fix the 474 files it names; this module is what judges every one of
them, and what stops the prose drifting back afterwards.

Fourteen rules can be held mechanically - a sweep reads the tracked tree,
reports a file, a line and what it found, and is silent when the prose is
clean. Each sweep is proven able to fail before it is trusted: a breach is
planted in `tests/fixtures/writing-style/`, and the sweep must report it
before a zero from the real tree means anything (`PBW-E1`, `PBW-E2`).

The sweeps landed before the batches that used them, and each batch skipped
the paths it had not yet corrected through a per-batch list under
`tests/writing_style_pending/`. The last batch deleted the last list, so every
tracked path is judged now and the scaffolding is gone (`PBW-D1`, `PBW-F6`).

`RULES` is a registry, not fourteen hand-written test bodies: `PBW-E1` proves
every rule in it in one loop, so a fifteenth rule cannot be added unproven.
Each rule owns its own patterns and its own named exemptions - the classes of
prose this covers have nothing in common beyond the text a reader sees, so a
shared matcher would fit none of them well.

# PBW-A6 - no citation points at a path git does not distribute

# A repository-relative path to a real file, shaped generically rather than
# anchored to any particular top-level directory: one or more `segment/`
# groups (the first may open with a single dot, for a dotdir such as
# `.compass/`), ending in a filename with a recognised extension. Finding
# 10, `review-dimensions.md`: this used to open with a hard-coded
# `(?:docs/compass|\.compass/work)/` prefix, deciding by an enumerated list
# what was even worth asking git about - the thing PBW-A6's own scenario
# forbids ("resolves its judgement from git's own ignore rules, not from a
# hard-coded prefix list"). `docs/analysis/` and `docs/proposals/` are also
# gitignored (`.gitignore:6-7`) and this issue's own source document lives
# in the former; neither was ever a candidate. Every path-shaped citation of
# a real file is now offered to `git check-ignore`, which is where the real
# judgement already lived. Requiring an extension, the same shape PBW-A8's
# `_REFERENCE_RE` below uses, is deliberate: a bare directory mention such
# as ".compass/work/" names the convention, not one document a reader
# cannot open, and the widened prefix would otherwise turn every one of the
# hundreds of ordinary mentions of that convention into a reported citation.
