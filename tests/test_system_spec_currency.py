"""docs/system-spec.md stays current, and stays house-style clean.

18 tasks are marked landed. The committed file carried scenarios from ONE, and
had gone fourteen consecutive Lands without being re-derived. Nobody noticed,
because nothing looked.

A derived artifact that nothing regenerates is worse than no artifact: it reads
as authoritative and is fiction. So the fix is not "regenerate it" - that makes
it right today. The fix is a test that re-derives and compares, which makes it
stay right.
