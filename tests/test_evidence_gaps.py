"""The evidence chain is as strong as the documents say it is.

Four gaps, each reproduced against HEAD before this file was written:

- `compass tdd-green --scenario X` recorded a green with no red on record for
  X, and printed "red -> green is on record" with zero red records on disk.
- An empty `.red` file - a bare `touch` - took the hook from exit 2 to exit 0
  and unlocked every production file for the issue.
- The hook refuses on spine-reader exit 3 and falls through on every other
  non-zero status, so an ImportError (exit 1) turned the acceptance check into
  a silent pass. Not visible from the obvious test: with no red on record the
  later check refuses first and masks it.
- `stop.sh` exited 127 without python3 instead of degrading.
