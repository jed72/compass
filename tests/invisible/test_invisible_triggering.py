"""Tests for invisible triggering (`TRC-C1`, `TRC-C2`, `TRC-C3`, `TRC-F3`).

These are static content-assertion tests. Invisible triggering is prompt-only
(no new hook code). The test strategy:
  - Read compass-contract.md and assert the intent-triggering rule paragraph
    is present.
  - Read each agent file and assert the supporting sentence is present.
  - Assert the rule does not instruct re-running assess when an already-
    assessed issue is active (TRC-F3 guard).
  - Assert the rule is additive (the existing "Never skip assessment" text
    still present and untouched).

Manual-verification note (behaviour at runtime, `TRC-C1` / `TRC-C3`):
  These tests check the static content that produces the agent behaviour.
  The runtime behaviour (an agent actually calling /compass:assess on
  natural-language intent) needs a live agent session; the manual-review
  record is in the gitignored issue archive.
