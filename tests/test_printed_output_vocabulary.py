"""No retired vocabulary name reaches a screen.

`compass approach evaluate` is the screen the demo recording holds longest,
and it printed both vocabularies at once: `FINAL APPROACH : initiative` four
lines above `route raised standard -> expedition`, so a viewer saw two
different answers to the same question.

They survived because the vocabulary scan treats a whitespace-free identifier
as a machine name, and a stage key is whitespace-free. The fix here is at the
print boundary - the machine keys are unchanged, so no retired name can be
printed whatever the underlying key is called. Renaming the keys needs a
back-compat shim and belongs to the rename slice.

Scenario ids: see .compass/work/identifiers-and-vocabulary-in-printed-output/
acceptance-criteria.md (groups B, C, E).
