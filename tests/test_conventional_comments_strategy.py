"""Review comments carry a plain-word label.

A review thread where "this will crash on an empty list" and "I'd have named
this differently" look identical costs the author a decision they should not
have to make: which of these blocks the merge. The convention answers it in
one word at the front of the comment.

Adopted as a SHIPPED DEFAULT rather than a project preference, on two
grounds. It serves the review gate, which is the centre of the pipeline. And
the labels are ordinary English - issue, suggestion, nitpick, question,
praise - so an adopting team inherits no jargon with them.
