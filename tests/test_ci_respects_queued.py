"""`compass ci` does not fail an issue that has not started.

The framework asks people to triage work early so nothing happens off the
books. Until now the reward for doing that was a red sweep: an issue with a
delivery approach but no acceptance criteria yet fails `scenarios-have-tests`,
`scenario-has-id-and-intent` and `suite-passed`, and takes the sweep down
with it. A tool that penalises the behaviour it asks for teaches people to
stop complying.

This repository only avoids the problem because `.compass/work/` is
gitignored, so the sweep in continuous integration finds nothing to check and
passes without checking anything. An adopter who commits their archive - which the framework
tells them to do, since it is their audit trail - meets it on day one.

The sweep still lists every issue it saw and says why one was not checked.
Nothing hides; a queued issue simply does not fail a build for being queued.

Scenario ids: see docs/system-spec.md (TRC-1, TRC-2).
