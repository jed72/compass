"""Counts short codes that reach a reader before their meaning does.

The rule: the plain words come first, the code follows in brackets. "a human
signs off on the irreversible (G5)" is right. Both "the G5 guard kicked in" and
"G5 fired, which means a human signs off on the irreversible" are wrong - the
second is the one proximity alone gets wrong, because the gloss is adjacent and
the reader still met the code first. **The order is the rule, not the nearness.**

Two design decisions a reader should be able to argue with:

**The registry of meanings is DERIVED from governance, never hand-written.**
`guardrails.yml` states G1-G5, the strategy headings state S1-S12, and
`terminology.yml`'s `codes:` block already carries a `means:` per id prefix. A
hand-written table would drift from the governance it describes and the drift
would be silent - the check would keep passing while describing codes that had
been renamed. The cost is that this couples to the shape of three files and can
break for reasons unrelated to writing. That break is loud; drift is not.

**A place is exempt when the identifier is the WHOLE of its content**, not
because of where it sits. A ledger cell holding `TRC-C6` is an index entry; a
cell holding `TRC-C6 - the baseline records its reach` is a sentence that put
its code first. A positional exemption gets widened by adding positions, which
is what ADR-015 did to markdown fences, Python literals and YAML values before
ADR-018 inverted the default. A content test has nothing to add.

Nothing here can fail a build. `EmptyRegistry` is the one exception and it is
not a style failure: it means the check could not see its own inputs, and a
zero from a blind check is worse than no number at all.
