"""Every reader asks the resolver where a document is.

Scenario group C of `docs-compass-artifacts`.

A document that has moved is not found by a reader that builds its own path to
it, and the failure is silent: the reader gets "no such file" and reports the
document as absent, which most checks treat as "nothing to check" and pass on.
That silent pass is the most expensive failure this group guards against,
and `TRC-C5` pins the worst instance - `dod-evidence-typed` goes GREEN on
every issue in a repository if the verification report moves and its
reader does not.

The class test (TRC-C3) is the one that matters most. Fixing thirteen
readers one at a time and calling the job done is exactly the failure this
group exists to prevent, so the guard enumerates the document kinds and
fails on any direct path join to one of them.
