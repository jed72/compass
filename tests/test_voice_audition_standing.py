"""The voice audition becomes a standing strategy (issue voice-audition-standing).

Slice 1 (`tests/test_human_voice.py`) wrote the reference (`writing-voice.md`),
its worked example, and the reviewer's clarity-dimension pointer for one
cycle. The maintainer's instruction at the close of that cycle was that the
audition does not lapse: it is a permanent review dimension for any slice
that writes prose, judged against a joint calibration sample - the worked
example rewrite and the "Never stash across a worktree hop" section of
`skills/worktree-swarm/SKILL.md`. This file pins that the standing strategy
says so, and that the reviewer's clarity dimension points at it without
repeating it.

Kept separate from `test_human_voice.py` rather than added to it: that file's
traceability ids (TRC-A1..A4, B1..B3, C1..C3, D1, F3) belong to the
`human-voice` issue's own `acceptance-criteria.md`. This issue has its own
criteria and its own TRC ids in
`.compass/work/voice-audition-standing/acceptance-criteria.md`; reusing the
same ids in the same file would make two different scenarios answer to one
traceability id, which breaks the very chain this strategy is about.

Criteria: .compass/work/voice-audition-standing/acceptance-criteria.md
(Requirements review and design collapsed on this quick fix - see
`.compass/work/voice-audition-standing/delivery-approach.md` §5.)
