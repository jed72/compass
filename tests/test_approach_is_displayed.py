"""The computed delivery approach is displayed, not a placeholder.

`compass check` and `compass flow` must show the manifest's
`delivery_approach`, never a placeholder. Two display sites read the retired
`route` key instead and fell back to `?`, confirmed against all 18 open
issues in this repository - the value was sitting in the manifest the whole
time. The vocabulary scan caught neither, because it treats a
whitespace-free string literal in `cli/compass_pkg/` as a machine
identifier, and `'route'` is exactly that shape (ADR-015 records the
widening).

Scenario ids: see docs/system-spec.md (group E).
