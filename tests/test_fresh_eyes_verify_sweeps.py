"""The fresh-eyes practice becomes a standing strategy (issue fresh-eyes-verify-sweeps).

The maintainer's instruction: after a sweep, rename, or cleanup that touches
many files, a fresh agent that has not seen the change checks the work -
not the one that made it. The author of a sweep checks their own work
against a mental list of what they changed, not against the goal, so the
files they forgot are exactly the files they do not think to look for. Two
cleanups missed files in this repository's own history, and the agent that
made each one reported it complete - that is the evidence this strategy
exists to act on.

This file pins the strategy entry in `governance/strategies.md` and the
pointer from the verify stage guidance (`commands/verify.md`,
`skills/evidence-gates/SKILL.md`) that names where it lives without
repeating it.

Criteria: docs/system-spec.md
