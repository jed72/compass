"""`compass init` - the verb that makes a directory a Compass project.

Before this, nothing owned initialisation. `/compass:init` created
`.compass/config.yml` and `.compass/work/` at steps 4 and 5 of a governance
conversation, `/compass:assess` created `.compass/work/<slug>/` as a side
effect, and four of the five role entry points assumed the directory existed
without creating it. There was no `init` verb, so initialisation could be
described but not checked.
