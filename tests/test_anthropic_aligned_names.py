"""The command, agent and skill names renamed to match Anthropic's vocabulary.

ADR-023 records the rule. Eight filenames move under it. Since 4.0.0
(ADR-024) a retired command name is an unknown command. `docs/releasing.md`
tells a caller what to type instead.

| Was | Is | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `agents/navigator.md` | `agents/router.md` | their "Routing" workflow pattern, and it runs routing-policy.yml <!-- vocabulary-scan: allow - the rename table must name the retired filename --> |
| `agents/product-lens.md` | `agents/product-owner.md` | named for the role, which governance already lists <!-- vocabulary-scan: allow - the rename table must name the retired filename --> |
| `agents/marketing-lens.md` | `agents/product-marketer.md` | same <!-- vocabulary-scan: allow - the rename table must name the retired filename --> |
| `agents/architect-lens.md` | `agents/architect.md` | same <!-- vocabulary-scan: allow - the rename table must name the retired filename --> |
| `commands/roundtable.md` | `commands/consult.md` | an advisor is "consulted mid-turn" <!-- vocabulary-scan: allow - the rename table must name the retired filename --> |
| `skills/intent-elicitation` | `skills/intent-interview` | their onboarding doc runs an "interview" <!-- vocabulary-scan: allow - the rename table must name the retired directory --> |
| `skills/blueprint-distillation` | `skills/behaviour-mapping` | distillation means model distillation to this audience <!-- vocabulary-scan: allow - the rename table must name the retired directory --> |
| `skills/worktree-swarm` | `skills/worktree-multiagent` | swarm is another vendor's framework name <!-- vocabulary-scan: allow - the rename table must name the retired directory --> |
