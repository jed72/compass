"""The skills and agents speak the v2 register.

These tests check:

  * `skills/` is enforced - it has left both terminology pending lists;
  * `agents/` is scanned and never pending;
  * the worktree-multiagent skill carries the "never stash across a
    worktree hop" rule;
  * the role-perspective ban catches the concept, but not a hyphenated
    agent identifier such as `product-owner`, which keeps its spelling
    until an agent-rename decision.
