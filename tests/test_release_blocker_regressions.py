"""Regression tests for six release-blocking defects that shipped with only a
manual check behind them.

Each fix below was verified by hand at the time - a temp project built, a
command run, the output read - and then had nothing left on disk that would
notice it breaking again. That is the shape of defect this repository keeps
finding in itself: a correct outcome with no standing assertion behind it. Each
test here was confirmed to fail against the pre-fix version of its file, so it
detects the defect rather than merely describing it.

Covered:
  SCN-01  scripts/validate.sh must not fail on untracked files
  SCN-02  the hook must enforce inside a repo whose own path contains "test"
  SCN-03  scripts/swarm.sh must not copy evidence/ or .red into a worktree
  SCN-08  the CI workflow must install Python before running a Python tool
  SCN-10  a Spike route must still report an owed backfill
  SCN-11  `compass ship-commit` must refuse to mark landed over unpassed gates
  SCN-12  `compass issue receipt` must not print "landed cleanly" over pending gates
  SCN-13  `compass analyze` must not report 0 findings after listing findings
"""

# These tests read `compass check`'s PER-CHECK detail - a check's name,
# its PASS/FAIL and the reason it gave. That detail moved to --verbose on
# 2026-08-24 when the gate verdict came under the terminal output contract;
# the checks themselves are unchanged. The assertions are re-pointed rather
# than rewritten, because what they assert still holds - only where it is
# printed changed.
