"""The suite runs with nothing added to PYTHONPATH.

Scenario BPF-1, in `bare-pytest-fails-on-two-tests/delivery-approach.md`.

`pytest.ini` puts the repository root on `sys.path`, so a bare `pytest -q`
runs the two tests that import from the `tests` package. The suite must pass
with no PYTHONPATH set, because `compass tdd-green -- pytest -q` runs the
command without the caller's shell prefix. If it cannot, the
`verify.regression` gate cannot be cleared by following Compass's own
instructions.
