"""The pytest-bdd reference adapter (task executable-bdd-and-richer-plans).

`compass bdd extract` produces a .feature file. On its own that proves the
extractor works, not that the output is *usable*. The worked project under
examples/bdd-adapters/pytest-bdd/ closes that gap: a real runner consumes the
real output and reports per-scenario results tagged with their TRC ids.

Why this cannot live in the main suite. pytest-bdd is a pytest PLUGIN, and this
repository disables pytest plugin autoload everywhere by design - Makefile, the
CI workflow, and scripts/release.sh all set PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1,
with the reasoning in pytest.ini. Under those runs pytest-bdd never loads. So
the adapter gets its own CI job, with autoload on and pytest-bdd installed, and
the tests below skip locally when it is absent.

A skipped test proves nothing, which is why TRC-B4 checks that the CI job
actually exists rather than trusting that someone will add it.

Spec: .compass/work/executable-bdd-and-richer-plans/acceptance-criteria.md (TRC-B1..B4).
