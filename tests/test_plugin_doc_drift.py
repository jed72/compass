"""Acceptance tests for task fix-plugin-doc-drift.

Each test_trc_* function asserts the fix for one scenario in
.compass/work/fix-plugin-doc-drift/spec.feature.md. The "production" change
is text in README.md, AGENTS.md, and docs/*.md, so these tests are grep/regex
assertions over the published doc files.

Why this file exists separate from the rest of tests/: the existing test
suite defends the CLI's safety contract (see tests/README.md). These tests
defend a one-off documentation fix. They are still real tests - they run
under `pytest tests/`, they fail when the docs drift, and `compass tdd-red`
/ `compass tdd-green` write typed test-run evidence the verify gates accept.
