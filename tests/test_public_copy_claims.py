"""Public copy does not claim an outside user, or time one.

Two standing constraints meet here. Nobody outside this repository has used
Compass, so no shipped file may say or imply otherwise. And B2 - the
cold-user test that would have measured how long a first run takes - was
skipped by maintainer decision, so any duration attached to a user's
experience is unmeasured rather than merely unproven, and may not appear in
public copy.

ADR-013 breached both in one clause: its Context said the install "failed on
the machine of someone who had known Compass for ninety seconds", in the past
tense, which reads as a report of a real outside user and carries a timing
figure. The issue's own working artifacts phrased the same point
hypothetically; the tense drifted when the reasoning was lifted into a
published record.

Scope note: this scans the files a reader can actually clone. `.compass/work/`
and `docs/proposals/` are gitignored, so what they say is working material
rather than public copy, and they are deliberately not scanned.
