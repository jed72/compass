"""The scenarios-are-executable check (task phase-2-skills-check-and-cli-split).

`compass bdd extract` shipped last task, so a project can run its Gherkin.
Nothing checked that it did - which left the scenario-to-test link a convention
one level up from where it started.

Two constraints shape everything here:

  * `compass check` is the fast mechanical gate. It runs in CI, in hooks, and on
    machines that never installed the project's dev dependencies, so it CANNOT
    run the BDD suite. It reads a record written by `compass bdd verify`.
  * A record is only evidence if it still describes the spec it claims to
    verify. Staleness is detected by the spec's content hash, never by mtime -
    `git checkout` rewrites mtimes, so a fresh CI clone would read every stale
    record as current. That is a false green in the exact place it matters most.

The common path is a project that has wired no runner at all. It must pass,
with a reason - a check that punished projects for not opting in would be worse
than no check.

Spec: .compass/work/phase-2-skills-check-and-cli-split/spec.feature.md (TRC-C1..C6).
"""

# These tests read `compass check`'s PER-CHECK detail - a check's name,
# its PASS/FAIL and the reason it gave. That detail moved to --verbose on
# 2026-08-24 when the gate verdict came under the terminal output contract;
# the checks themselves are unchanged. The assertions are re-pointed rather
# than rewritten, because what they assert still holds - only where it is
# printed changed.
