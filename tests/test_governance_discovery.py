"""Governance discovery never silently substitutes the shipped defaults.

Issue: claims-match-what-is-proved. Scenarios TRC-A1 to TRC-A6 and TRC-F1.

The bug these cover: `find_governance` looked upward for
`governance/routing-policy.yml`. A project that shipped `governance/guardrails.yml`
beside no routing policy got the framework's own governance instead, with
nothing printed - so their guardrails never ran and nothing said so. That
contradicts the safety contract's promise that a declared guardrail cannot
silently become advisory.

The line drawn here: Compass refuses when a project has declared something it
cannot honour. It stays silent when the project has said nothing, which is the
day-one, zero-setup case and a documented promise.
