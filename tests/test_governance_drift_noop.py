"""Invariants for governance drift detection (task governance-drift-detection).

This task has critical blast radius, and the one unacceptable outcome is
changing how routes are computed. A drift detector that alters routing is worse
than the silent drift it was built to find.

The other properties here are about trust. A detector that fires on a project
which is current, or which has never run `/compass:init`, or which is AHEAD of
the framework, is a detector that gets switched off - and then it detects
nothing at all.

Spec: .compass/work/governance-drift-detection/spec.feature.md (TRC-F1..F6).
