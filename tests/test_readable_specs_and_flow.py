"""Acceptance tests for task readable-specs-and-flow.

Each test_trc_* function asserts one scenario in
.compass/work/readable-specs-and-flow/acceptance-criteria.md.

Why these are regex assertions over markdown rather than unit tests: the
"production" change for most of this task is the text of shipped templates,
skills, agents and commands. That is the same situation
tests/test_plugin_doc_drift.py is in, and these follow its approach. The
executable half of the task (the `compass plan lint` subcommand) is tested
separately in tests/test_no_placeholders_check.py, where real unit tests are
possible.

These are still real tests: they run under `pytest tests/`, they fail when the
shipped text drifts, and `compass tdd-red` / `compass tdd-green` write typed
test-run evidence from them that the verify gates accept.

# The vocabulary rename landed on 2026-08-25: the assess and plan stages took

# intent.md. Spines and documents written before still load and resolve
