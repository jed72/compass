"""`compass issue set-status` names the issue it acted on.

It printed "None" instead, in both the success line and the refusal, because
`cli/compass_pkg/task_spine.py` read `task.get("issue")` while the spine's root
key for the slug is `task:`. The `--json` result dropped the field altogether,
so a consumer reading it to learn which issue changed state got nothing.

The refusal is the one that mattered: it is what a person meets when shipping
is blocked, usually with several issues in flight, and "refusing to mark 'None'
landed" cannot tell them which one refused.
