"""The checkable claims in the most-read documents match the live policy.

The vocabulary scan guards words. Numbers and claims were not guarded, and
they drifted: the routing deep dive gave gate counts the evaluator does not
compute, called `verify.claims` immovable when the policy says it is
role-scoped, and the derived-spec header named an input and a path the
derivation does not use.

This is a small, explicit registry, not a document compiler. Each entry names
a document, the sentence that makes a claim, and the live fact it claims. The
fact is computed from `governance/routing-policy.yml` through the same
evaluator `compass approach evaluate` runs, or from the CLI's own code. A claim
that is reworded so its pattern no longer matches fails too, so the registry
moves with the prose.

Scenario ids: FDG-1 to FDG-5, in the delivery approach of issue
`facts-drift-guard`.
