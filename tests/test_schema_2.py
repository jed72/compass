"""Schema 2.0 - the machine manifest speaks the frozen v2 vocabulary.

These tests check:

  * the manifest's keys use their v2 names (assessment/risk/familiarity/size/
    goal, labels, delivery_approach, stages, policy_rules_fired, follow_ups,
    reassessments);
  * writers emit schema_version "2.0";
  * readers accept a 1.x manifest by normalising its keys on load;
  * the repository's own work archive, and the example work directories,
    migrate in the same change.

The templates/manifest.yml scan exemption is gone. The runtime resolver's
v1 artifact-name fallback stays, by design (ADR-006), for a landed issue
that still carries the old filenames.

No behaviour change: same manifest, new names, the tests changed in the
same commit.
