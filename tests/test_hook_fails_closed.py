"""The pre-tool hook fails closed when it cannot read its own state.

`hooks/pre-tool.sh` enforces acceptance-before-code by reading the issue
spine through `scripts/lib/compass-python.sh`. That helper used `exec`, which
replaces the calling shell - including the shell holding the call site's
`|| true`. So when the vendored PyYAML could not be resolved, the hook aborted
under `set -euo pipefail` with exit 3 and printed nothing, and because the
hook's contract is block = 2 and allow = 0, the runtime read exit 3 as a
non-blocking error and let the edit through.

Measured before the fix, same input, same issue:

    cli/vendor/yaml intact      -> exit 2, 1013 bytes of refusal on stderr
    cli/vendor/yaml moved away  -> exit 3, zero bytes on both streams

That is the defect the vendoring work existed to fix, one layer down. ADR-013
describes the pre-vendoring version as "a guardrail that looked like it was
enforcing G2 was not enforcing anything at all"; removing the pip step closed
that case and opened a wider one, because the abort costs every check after
it rather than one.

Removing `exec` alone is not enough. It restores the `|| true` and returns the
hook to failing *quietly*, which is where it was before and is still wrong. A
guardrail that cannot read its own state must fail closed and say why, which
is what these tests pin.
