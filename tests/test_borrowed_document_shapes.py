"""The two documents the routing policy names, and the shapes they borrowed.

`governance/routing-policy.yml` promises a threat model on auth, payments or
personal-data work, and a rollback plan on migrations. Neither kind had a
template, so an issue was told it earned a document and given nothing to start
from.

WHY THESE SHAPES AND NOT OURS. Both are borrowed from published sources rather
than invented, and the criteria quote them so a reviewer can check the
borrowing rather than the author's taste:
