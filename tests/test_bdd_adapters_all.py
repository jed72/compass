"""All four BDD reference adapters (task bdd-adapters-and-skill-length).

The improvement plan asked for reference adapters for pytest-bdd, cucumber-js,
behave and godog. One shipped, and the pytest-bdd README told readers "the same
four steps apply" to three runners no adapter existed for - a claim recorded at
the time as only partially backed. These tests are what back it.

The rule these enforce, learned from the pytest-bdd adapter: **an example no job
runs is an example nobody can trust.** So an adapter ships only with CI that
runs it, and a test that skips because a runner is absent says so rather than
reporting success.

Spec: .compass/work/bdd-adapters-and-skill-length/acceptance-criteria.md (TRC-A1..A4,
      TRC-B1, TRC-B2, TRC-C1).
