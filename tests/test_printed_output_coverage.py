"""Every string the CLI prints is scanned for retired vocabulary.

The prose ban patterns are capitalisation-scoped on purpose: "before critical
changes land" is correct English, so a lowercase machine value like
`expedition` is invisible to them by design. The printed-output guard is the
only thing standing behind that gap, and it stood behind two of the CLI's
twenty-four commands - the two whose output a test happened to run.

Defence in depth only works if the second layer is complete. At two of
twenty-four, a retired name printed by any of the other twenty-two escaped
both layers. That is the defect ADR-018 names, one level up: coverage
asserted rather than established.

So this does not run commands and read their output. It walks the syntax tree
of every module under `cli/`, finds every call that writes to the terminal,
and reads the string literals those calls carry. Coverage is then a property
of the walk rather than a list somebody remembered to extend.
