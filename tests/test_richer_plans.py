"""Acceptance tests for richer plans (task executable-bdd-and-richer-plans).

Compass's plan template was Approach + design decisions + governance check +
work units. That is enough to coordinate work, but it does not let a reviewer
*see* the shape of a change before it is built. This task adds five optional
sections - a Summary preamble, a sequence diagram, a structural diagram, named
design patterns, and illustrative code - each carrying its own rule for when it
earns a place, governed by a new `plan-authoring` skill.

The sections are OPTIONAL by design. A plan that uses all five on a one-line
change is worse than one that uses none: ceremony is a cost. So these tests
check two things in tension - that the sections exist and are usable, and that
the template and skill tell an author when NOT to use them.

Every assertion below reads a shipped file. The precedent is
tests/test_plugin_doc_drift.py and tests/test_readable_specs_and_flow.py.

Spec: .compass/work/executable-bdd-and-richer-plans/spec.feature.md (TRC-C1..C6).

# The vocabulary rename landed on 2026-08-25: the assess and plan stages took
# the names their machine keys, skills and agents already used; `design` went
# back to the designer; design.md became technical-design.md and prd.md became
# intent.md. Spines and documents written before still load and resolve
# (ADR-006), so what moved is the CANONICAL spelling these tests assert - not
# what the framework computes. Re-pointed, not relaxed.
