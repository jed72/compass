"""The systematic-debugging skill (task phase-2-skills-check-and-cli-split).

Compass has always had `--reassess` for when the terrain was misread. It has
never said how to *notice*. This skill supplies the signal: three consecutive
failed fixes means the framing is wrong, not that a fourth fix is needed.

These assertions are over prose, which is the weakest kind of scenario Compass
writes - a skill can satisfy every regex and still be useless. What they can
enforce is that the method is present, ordered, actionable, and reachable from
the place the failure actually happens.

Spec: .compass/work/phase-2-skills-check-and-cli-split/acceptance-criteria.md (TRC-A1..A3).
