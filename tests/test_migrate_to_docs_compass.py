"""Moving an issue's documents out from beside its manifest.

Scenario group E of `docs-compass-artifacts`, plus `TRC-G2`.

`compass migrate` already renames v1 filenames and rewrites manifests to schema
2.0. This adds the relocation: human documents move to
`docs/compass/<created>-<slug>/` and the manifest's artifact registry is
written to name each one. Machine state - the manifest, `evidence/`, the
markers, the devlog - does not move, because that is what the CLI reads.

The dry run is the default and it has to promise exactly what the apply does.
A dry run that promises less is as hard to trust afterwards as one that
promises more.
