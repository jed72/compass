"""The injected contract says where Compass writes an issue's files.

`compass-contract.md` reaches every session through the SessionStart hook, so
a wrong sentence in it is read as a fact by every session. It once said every
stage writes under `.compass/work/<issue>/`. Since prose documents moved to
`docs/compass/<created>-<slug>/`, that sentence sent every reader to the wrong
directory, and `CLAUDE.md` repeated it.

These tests tie the two sentences to the CLI rather than to a copy of the
string. The document home comes from `issue_layout.docs_dir_for`, the one
naming rule every writer uses, and a scratch project proves that
`compass issue artifact-path` resolves a registered document there. If the
naming rule changes, the contract test fails until the sentence follows it.
