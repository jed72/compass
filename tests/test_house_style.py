"""House style invariants over the framework's own source.

These are invariants of *this repository*, not framework guardrails. They run
in this repo's pytest suite alongside `test_release_invariants.py`, never
against an adopting project's task, and never as a `compass check` gate.
Strategy S7 in `governance/strategies.md` is the reasoning; this file is the
mechanical half of the one house-style rule that has a mechanical half.

Two rules are enforced here:

1. No em dash (U+2014). Where an em dash would go, Compass writes a plain
   hyphen with spaces around it. En dashes (U+2013) are deliberately left
   alone: they carry meaning in ranges such as `G1-G5` and `2-3 streams`.
2. No agent co-author trailer in any tracked file. The human author owns the
   change; `devlog.md` and `manifest.yml` already record provenance in a form the
   framework can read.

The file list comes from `git ls-files`, which means this guard reads exactly
what the repository ships and gives the same answer on every machine. That is
deliberate, and it silently omitted something for months: the project's own
launch article lived in `docs/analysis/`, which `.gitignore` excludes as a
directory, so the one document written for strangers was the one document no
guard had ever read. It was absent from every fresh clone and from CI, so
nothing reported a gap - the scan simply had nothing to say about a file it
could not see.

The fix was to track what gets published, not to make this guard read untracked
files. Reading untracked files would have made the answer depend on whatever
each contributor keeps on disk, and would have passed in CI where those files
are absent entirely. Working notes and the campaign plan stay untracked and
stay unread, which is correct: nothing publishes them.

Still deliberately excluded: `assets/` (binary), `LICENSE` (verbatim Apache-2.0,
never edited for style), and the framework's own `.compass/work/`. The
`examples/*/.compass/work/` fixtures are committed on purpose and are scanned.

This file contains no literal em dash and no literal forbidden trailer. Every
needle is assembled from its parts at import time, so the scanners never have
to exempt themselves from their own rules.

    Compass has plenty of legitimate identifiers - G1 to G5, S1 to S7, Inv-1 to

    a reader can reach. The patterns below are the ones that were not: internal
    work-stream numbering and pointers into a per-task `architecture-notes.md`,
    which is never committed. A reader hitting one of those has no way to
    resolve it, which is what strategy S7 forbids.

    Scenario ids of the form `TRC-<letter><number>` are deliberately NOT
    scanned, and the distinction matters. They are the code-to-scenario half of
    the traceability chain guardrail G3 requires, not internal numbering: a
    test docstring naming one says which acceptance criterion that test exists
    to satisfy. Most of them resolve through `docs/system-spec.md`, which is
    derived at Land from landed task specs. The ones that do not resolve fail
    for a structural reason rather than a stylistic one: `.compass/work/` is
    gitignored, so the specs of the framework's own tasks were never committed.
    Deleting the ids would remove the visible half of a chain the project
    mandates without making a single spec easier to find. Closing that gap
    means making them resolve, not stripping them.

    Scope is every tracked file, not just prose: a comment in `cli/compass` or
    a test docstring is read by exactly the same person.

    Two exclusions. `docs/system-spec.md` is generated at Land from task specs
