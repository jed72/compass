"""The vocabulary rename: assess, plan, intent, technical-design.

Five words in this framework named more than one thing, or named a thing whose
own output disagreed with them:

  the stage that produces an `assessment:` block was called `triage`
  the stage whose key, skill and agent all say `plan` was commanded as `design`
  `design` named a command, an artifact, an artifact kind, a CLI verb and a
      role, and was the only overloaded word with no glossary entry
  `/compass:intent` wrote a file called `prd.md`
  `frame` was banned as a phase name and survived as a live machine key,
      because governance/*.yml is not a scanned surface

THE ORDER IS THE DESIGN. Every new spelling is accepted before any caller
switches to it - see design.md D2. These tests are written so the accept phase
can be green on its own.
