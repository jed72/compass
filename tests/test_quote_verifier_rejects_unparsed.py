"""A quote the verifier could not read is a failure, not a pass.

`scripts/verify-archive-quotes.py` exists to stop a fabricated archive quote
passing the build. Its own blind spot was the shape one step before
fabrication: a quote it could not parse at all.

`parse_pairs` sets `before` to `None` when the `Before:` block does not match
its blockquote pattern - a line written `>text` without the space is enough.
Downstream, `sha256_text(span["quoted"] or "")` hashed the empty string and
`_matches_archive("substring", "", archive_text)` reduced to `"" in
archive_text`, which is always true. So the span verified clean, and
`--update` would record `sha256("")` for it against a file it never matched.

That contradicted the script's own promise: `update_manifest` documents that
it "refuses - and writes nothing at all - if any span's archive file is
missing or does not contain the quoted text verbatim". A span that did not
parse belongs in that category and was not in it.
