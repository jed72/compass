"""The terminal output contract - what a person reads when they run a verb.

The terminal is a notification surface, not the artifact. A verb that ends a
stage or renders a verdict is a HAND-OFF and fits one screen; a verb somebody
runs deliberately to get detail is a REPORT and keeps its detail, but opens with
a summary they can stop at. Five flags choose how much they get.

Measured before any threshold here was written, on 2026-08-23:
  compass check          45 lines, 14 of them PASS lines, longest line 252 chars
  compass flow           156 lines
  compass approach evaluate   4 lines, one a raw Python dict
  208 print calls inside verb bodies, across 34 verbs
  37 test files asserting a literal string in stdout - 130 assertions
