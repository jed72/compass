"""Every slash command a shipped document names is one that exists (issue
stale-command-names-in-shipped-prose).

`skills/compass-runtime/writing-voice.md` showed `/compass:build`,
`/compass:land` and `/compass:clarify` in its worked examples. All three were
removed at 3.0.0, three major versions before this was noticed. It is the file
every agent loads before writing a devlog entry, a requirements review or a
line of dialogue, so sessions copied their voice from examples naming commands
that did not exist.

Nothing caught it. The vocabulary scan bans retired *stage words*; these are
slash-command spellings inside code spans, which the position rules treat as
identifiers rather than prose. And `tests/test_documented_commands_exist.py`
reads `compass <verb>`, never `/compass:<name>`.
