"""The two hooks ask the CLI where a document is.

Scenario group D of `docs-compass-artifacts`.

This group carries the highest consequence in the spec. `hooks/pre-tool.sh`
treats a missing `delivery-approach.md` beside the manifest as "assessment did
not complete" and **blocks every code edit in the project**. Move that file
without moving this reader and nobody can work.

The hooks are shell and cannot import the resolver, so they ask the CLI for the
path with `compass issue artifact-path <kind>`. One answer, from the same code
the Python readers use, rather than a second implementation in bash that drifts
from the first.
