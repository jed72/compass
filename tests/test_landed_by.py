"""An issue delivered through another issue can say so, checkably.

Six issues sat as `abandoned` with an empty record and had actually been
delivered - the fix arrived through a different issue. `abandoned` was the only
status that did not lie about the record, so it lied about the outcome instead,
in the one place `compass retro` reads to judge whether triage is drifting.

`landed_by:` moves the claim rather than waiving it. THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF
THIS FILE: relaxing a guardrail check is the move a project talks itself into
whenever a check is inconvenient, and six of these nine scenarios exist to prove
the relaxation only fires when the record genuinely exists somewhere else.
