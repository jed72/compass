"""Id prefixes are vocabulary, and they have somewhere to be looked up.

Compass artifacts are dense with short codes - TRC-A1, INT-1, EV-003, DD-2,
BF-1, RG-FLOOR-006 - and until this issue a reader meeting one had nowhere to
go. `governance/terminology.yml` defined 53 terms and not a single code.

Two of the prefixes were also wrong. `RG-` says *guardrail* for something that
is not one of the five hard rules; Compass already made that correction once,
renaming the manifest key `fired_guardrails` to `policy_rules_fired`, and the id
never followed. And four of the seven entries in the `floors:` block raise no
minimum at all - they attach a gate - so a glossary could not define `FLOOR`
honestly while they shared its name.

See ADR-016. Spec:
docs/system-spec.md.
