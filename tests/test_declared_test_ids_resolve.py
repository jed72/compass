"""A declared test id resolves when the test really is on disk.

`declared-tests-resolve` exists because a test being *named* satisfies the
tested-before-ship and traceability guardrails - so a scenario citing a test
nobody wrote is invisible by construction. The check closes that hole by
looking the name up in the file.

It looked it up two ways that cannot succeed:

  * It took only the segment after the final `::` and searched for that whole
    string verbatim. A jest-style id - `file::outer > inner > the test` - has
    one `::`, so the "name" became the entire `outer > inner > the test`
    chain, which appears nowhere in a file that writes those as nested
    `describe`/`it` calls.
  * It wrapped the name in `\\b...\\b`. A test name ending in a non-word
    character - `@`, `)`, `.` - can never satisfy the trailing boundary,
    whatever is on disk.

Both fail at verify, *after* correctness has been claimed, which is the worst
moment to discover a bookkeeping problem.
