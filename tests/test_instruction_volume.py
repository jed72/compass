"""What a session reads is bounded, and the bounds are measured not asserted.

Two numbers, and they are different things:

  RESIDENT   in context on every turn whether used or not - the frontmatter
             descriptions of every skill, command and agent, plus the contract
             the SessionStart hook injects.
  PER RUN    what a session actually reads following the instructions for one
             quick fix, end to end.

Measured at HEAD before this issue: 1,744 words resident (~2,354 tokens) and
19,448 words per run (~26,254), rising to 26,567 (~35,865) with
`governance/strategies.md`, which `CLAUDE.md` told the model to read at the
start of every issue. Superpowers is about 900 tokens resident.

The ceilings below are the issue's success signals. They are deliberately not
"whatever it is today plus a bit": a ceiling that tracks the tree cannot fail.
