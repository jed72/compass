"""Measure before arguing is standing practice, not one issue's lesson.

When a recommendation and an instruction disagree, the cheap move is to
restate the recommendation more forcefully. Twice now, measuring the disputed
quantity instead has changed the outcome:

  * The vendored-YAML fork. The argument was about whether bundling PyYAML
    was worth its cost; the measurement was the artifact size and a run on an
    interpreter that genuinely could not import it.
  * Two of three decisions on the 3.0.0 stub removal. The author recommended
    against deleting the flag aliases and against scanning fenced code
    blocks. Counting the call sites (268 and 69) and the tightened scan's
    hits (200 across 38 files) showed both objections were about a sprawl
    that was not there.

The practice is written down because it has to reach a session that has never
read this file's history.
