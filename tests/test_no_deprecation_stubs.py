"""No deprecation stub survives the major version.

The v2 vocabulary freeze renamed the pipeline's commands and verbs, leaving a
redirect behind each one for "one major version". That window was written for
adopters, and there are none - so every redirect was a promise kept to nobody,
and the window would have closed the moment someone installed from the
marketplace.

ADR-014 removes them at 3.0.0 while the cost is zero. What stays is the
migrator's v1-to-v2 mapping, which is a translation table rather than a
redirect: a stub answers a caller who used the old name, a mapping reads a
file that used it.

The removal is also what makes ADR-015 possible - a scan cannot ban a name
the machinery still answers to.

Scenario ids: see docs/system-spec.md (group F).
