"""No deprecation stub outlives the version it was scheduled for removal in.

The v2 vocabulary freeze renamed the pipeline's commands and verbs, leaving a
redirect behind each one for "one major version". ADR-014 removed those at
3.0.0, while Compass had no adopters and the removal cost nothing.

ADR-019 supersedes that rule now Compass is published and released at 3.3.0.
A name retired INSIDE a major version keeps working until the next one, so
an adopter who upgrades is not broken; a name retired AT a major version is
still deleted outright. Every surviving stub is named individually below,
with the version it goes at - which is what stops a redirect layer becoming
open-ended, and is the thing ADR-014 was actually protecting against.

What stays either way is the migrator's v1-to-v2 mapping. That is a
translation table rather than a redirect: a stub answers a caller who used the
old name, a mapping reads a file that used it.

Scenario ids: see docs/system-spec.md (group F).
