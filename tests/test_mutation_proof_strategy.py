"""Mutation proof is standing practice, not this cycle's habit.

The 2.1.0 release found five guards that reported success while checking
nothing, and four of them had passing tests the whole time. A passing test
proves the guard runs. It does not prove the guard is connected to the thing
it names.

The case that settles it: `test_version_guard_covers_every_location.py` was
written specifically to close that class, passed its own tests, and performed
zero comparisons on the single location it existed for. Setting both version
banners to `9.9.9` left it green. Nothing but breaking the subject would have
shown that.

Scenario ids: see docs/system-spec.md.
