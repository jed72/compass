"""Reshaping an ingested brief into intent.md - the rules, made checkable.

The maintainer's instruction was "never take it verbatim, ask questions where
needed", so Compass rewrites someone else's document. That is the whole value
and the whole danger: an invented non-goal reads exactly like a decided one,
and a reader cannot tell them apart afterwards.

`requirements-review.md` Q2 turned that into a rule a test can hold - **every
statement in intent.md traces to the source or to a recorded answer, and there
is no third origin** - and this file is where it is held. The skill teaches the
discipline; the validator below is what makes the discipline checkable rather
than aspirational.
