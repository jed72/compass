"""The operating contract reaches a session without the model choosing it.

Before this, the contract reached a Claude Code session only if the model
picked `compass-runtime` from its description. `CLAUDE.md` applies inside the
Compass repository and nowhere else, so an adopter's session got nothing.

It also existed twice. Measured sentence by sentence before the change:
`CLAUDE.md` and `skills/compass-runtime/SKILL.md` shared 46 sentences
verbatim - 39% of `CLAUDE.md` - and they had already drifted, with
`compass-runtime` naming nine agents and omitting `architect`.

`AGENTS.md` is deliberately NOT part of this. It shares no sentence with
either, because it is the runtime-neutral expression for Codex, Amp and
Cursor, and other runtimes are this cycle's non-goal.

Scenario ids: SB-A1..A3, SB-B1..B4, SB-C1, SB-C2, SB-D1, SB-D2 in
