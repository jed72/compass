# Install smoke test

Use this checklist after installing Compass or changing its installation.
Run it in a scratch Git repository so the test issue does not enter a real
project.

## 1. Check the prerequisites

```bash
python3 --version
git --version
```

Compass requires Python 3. Its CI currently tests Python 3.11. The CLI bundles
its required YAML parser; `jsonschema` is optional.

## 2. Install Compass

### Plugin marketplace

Inside Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add jed72/compass
/plugin install compass@compass
```

Restart Claude Code if the new commands are not immediately visible.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jed72/compass.git
cd compass
bash scripts/install.sh --global
```

Use `--project <directory>` for a project-scoped install or `--copy` when
symlinks are unsuitable.

For an organisational install, pin the checkout to a reviewed commit rather
than following a branch. See [Security](security.md).

## 3. Check the CLI

From a source checkout:

```bash
python3 cli/compass --version
python3 cli/compass policy lint
```

Expect:

```text
compass 3.4.0 (issue schema 2.0)
PyYAML 6.0.2 at .../cli/vendor/yaml/__init__.py
```

The PyYAML path is the point: it must be the bundled copy, not one from your
environment. Policy lint should end in `PASS`.

To prove the CLI is not relying on packages from your Python environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv --without-pip /tmp/compass-bare-check
/tmp/compass-bare-check/bin/python3 cli/compass --version
```

Install `jsonschema` separately only if you want full JSON Schema validation:

```bash
python3 -m pip install jsonschema
```

## 4. Create a scratch issue

In a scratch Git repository, open Claude Code and run:

```text
/compass:assess "Test the Compass installation"
```

Confirm that Compass created:

```text
.compass/current-task
.compass/work/test-the-compass-installation/
```

The exact slug may vary. The issue directory should contain at least
`task.yml` and `delivery-approach.md`.

Generate the review dashboard:

```bash
compass issue dashboard --issue <issue-slug>
```

Open the generated `README.md`. It should show the route, artefact pack,
omissions, approval state and next action.

If `/compass:assess` is unknown, the adapter is not loaded. Restart Claude
Code, then check the plugin installation or source-install wiring.

## 5. Confirm an incomplete issue fails honestly

From the scratch repository, run the CLI against the issue:

```bash
compass check --issue <issue-slug>
```

For a newly assessed issue, failure is expected: acceptance, implementation
and verification evidence do not exist yet. A healthy result:

- identifies the missing check;
- explains why it matters;
- gives a next action; and
- exits non-zero without a Python traceback.

A traceback or “governance not found” error indicates an installation or path
problem rather than an uncleared gate.

## 6. Check the hooks

Start a small delivery issue, define one scenario, then try to edit production
code before recording a failing test. The pre-tool hook should block the edit
and explain how to record the red test.

Do not run this check on a spike: spikes deliberately suspend the
red-before-green strategy.

For a source install, confirm the Claude Code settings contain Compass entries
for:

- `hooks/pre-tool.sh`;
- `hooks/post-tool.sh`; and
- `hooks/stop.sh`.

These hooks run with your user permissions. Review them before using Compass
in a sensitive environment.

## 7. Test source uninstall and reinstall

This step applies only to source installs:

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh --uninstall
bash scripts/install.sh --global
bash scripts/install.sh --global
```

Uninstall should remove only the Claude Code adapter wiring. Both reinstall
runs should succeed without duplicate hook entries.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Command is unknown | Restart Claude Code; verify the plugin or source adapter path. |
| `policy lint` cannot find governance | Run from the project or use the CLI from a complete Compass checkout. |
| Edit is blocked | Record a failing test first, or confirm the issue is correctly assessed as a spike. |
| Hooks were not registered | Install `jq` and rerun the source installer, or follow its manual instructions. |
| Existing Compass directory is not overwritten | Move the unrelated directory aside; the installer fails safely. |

If a failure is not covered here, report the exact command, exit code and
output. Remove secrets before attaching logs.
