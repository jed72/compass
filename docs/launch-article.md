# My spec-driven dev tool works for me. That's the problem.

A few weeks ago I noticed which Compass command I was running most. Not the one
that frames a task, or the one that checks the work. It was the one that quietly
admits I got the framing wrong and re-does it. I built the tool to stop me
cutting corners, and the part I reach for most is the part that says "you called
this one wrong, start that bit again."

That's an odd thing to admit about something you built. It's also the most useful
thing I can tell you about it.

Here's the situation. I've been using Compass on my own work for a few weeks. It's
held up. I'm less annoyed than I was, the small changes stay small, and the scary
ones get the full treatment. But "it works for me" is about the lowest bar there
is. A tool whose whole job is to decide how much process a piece of work needs has,
so far, only ever been judged by one person's judgement: mine. That isn't tested.
It's just my own taste, automated. So I'm putting it out to find out whether the
idea survives other people.

## The quick version of what it does

In case you've not seen it. Most spec-driven setups run every change through the
same steps. What actually happens then is that people do the full ceremony on the
big, scary change and quietly skip it on the typo, because doing the whole routine
for a one-line fix is daft and everyone knows it. So the process ends up covering
the changes that were never going to hurt you, and getting skipped on some that
might.

Compass tries to fix that by splitting the rules in two. There are a few hard
guardrails that never move: tested before it lands, acceptance defined before it's
built, a human signs off on anything irreversible. And there's a set of softer
strategies, like TDD and BDD, which are the usual way of meeting those guardrails
but which you can step off, with a reason. Then it reads a few plain things about
the task, how risky it is, how big, whether it's greenfield or you're cutting into
something that already exists, and works out how much process to apply. A small
change gets a light path. A new subsystem gets the full set. The hard rules hold
either way.

I wrote that part up properly a little while back, if you want the longer version.

## The bit that made me trust it

I want to give you a concrete thing rather than a claim, and it's the only part of
this I'd point at if you asked why I still use it.

Compass keeps a record of what proved each change. Each record has a type, and the
types are a hierarchy of who can check it: at the top, a test run a machine
executed and recorded; below that, output from a command someone captured; below
that, a judgement a person wrote down for a reviewer to weigh. The gates read
those types. It's the part I was least sure about when I built it, because a
record of your own work is the easiest thing in the world to quietly write in your
favour.

Last week I found out what it does when I'm the one being sloppy.

I'd run the test suite and watched it pass. I'd run it in a way that produced no
machine record, and rather than run it again I wrote a small file saying it had
passed. Which was true. The gate refused it: the file claimed to be a recorded
test run and had no exit code in it, no trace of a process having actually run and
returned something.

So I fixed that one and re-ran the check. It refused the next one. Then the next.
Six records in a row, every one written by me, every one labelled as the strongest
kind of proof, and not one of them was. They were honest notes about work I had
genuinely done - and every one was claiming a machine had confirmed it when only I
had.

The fix wasn't to add fake exit codes. It was to relabel each one truthfully: my
transcription of a test run is captured output, and my write-up of an experiment is
a judgement for a reviewer to assess. Nothing about what happened changed. What
changed was the claim attached to it. After that the gate passed, resting only on
the nine records a machine had actually produced.

That's the distinction the whole tool is built on, and I'd never had it
demonstrated on me before. I built the thing, I knew the rule, I had good reasons
to be in a hurry, and it wouldn't take my word for it six times running.

And it wasn't a one-off. Building that same release, four different parts of the
tool refused me:

- the evidence gate, on six records in a row, as above
- a rule I'd just written banning unexplained shorthand - which caught me using
  unexplained shorthand in the very file where I was writing the rule, inside a
  minute
- a check that pins the list of guidance the project ships, which refused two new
  entries until I wrote down that I'd added them on purpose
- a scan I'd narrowed to cover more files, which immediately found something in
  the newly covered ones

Every one of those was correct. None of them was a bug I then had to fix; they
were the tool declining to let me skip a step, four times, in one week, on my own
project.

If you're weighing this up: that's the behaviour you're buying. Not process for its
own sake - a system that won't accept "it's fine, I checked" from anybody,
including the person who wrote it. I'd rather show you that than tell you it's
rigorous.

## Where I already know it's thin

Let me save you the trouble of finding the obvious holes, because I've found a few
of them already.

It's all been solo. I've never run it with a team, which is awkward, because half
the point of process is getting people to agree, and I've no idea how it behaves
when two people frame the same work differently. The whole thing leans on the
framing being roughly right, and as I said, the command I reach for most is the one
for when it isn't. I haven't pointed it at a big, messy, legacy codebase and
watched it struggle. And there's a fair chance that some of the things I think are
clever are just things that happen to suit the way I work.

None of that is false modesty. It's the actual state of it.

## Two things I'd genuinely like help with

First, use it on something small and throwaway, and tell me where it fights you.
Not just the obvious bugs, though do tell me those. I mean where the process it
picks feels wrong, or a guardrail gets in the way for no good reason, or you'd
plainly have done it differently. I learn far more from "this annoyed me, and
here's why" than from a star on the repo.

Second, tell me where to take it next. Right now it only plugs into Claude Code,
because that's what I use and it's all I've had time to build. The routing and the
checks are kept separate from any of that on purpose, so it could in principle run
elsewhere, but "could" is doing a lot of work in that sentence, and porting it
properly is real effort. So before I spend that time, I'd rather know what people
actually want: Cursor, Codex, Gemini, or just a plain command-line version with no
agent attached at all. If you've got a preference, that's the sort of thing that'll
decide what I do next.

Building the thing was the easy part, as it usually is. The bit I can't do on my
own is find out whether an adaptive take on this holds up once it meets work that
isn't mine and habits that aren't mine. That's the whole reason it's out this
early, rough edges and all. I'd rather hear where it falls over now than keep
polishing something that only ever made sense to one person.

If you want to try it, it's on GitHub at
[github.com/jed72/compass](https://github.com/jed72/compass). In Claude Code you
can add it as a plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add jed72/compass
/plugin install compass@compass
```

Then start a task with `/compass:frame "..."`. There is nothing else to install -
the plugin carries what it needs - and the defaults work out of the box, so
there's nothing to set up first. It's early, so point it at a branch you don't mind
burning.
