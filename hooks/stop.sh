# Compass hook: stop.sh  -  END-OF-SESSION GATE-STATE WARNER
# =============================================================================
# Runs as a Claude Code Stop hook, when a session ends. It does not block - a
# session is allowed to end. It prints a warning for each unfinished issue, so
# the next session or a person does not have to find it.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS, per issue under .compass/work/
#   1. the delivery-approach record missing on in-progress work
#        => an issue directory exists but has no delivery-approach.md. Work
#           with no delivery-approach record has no computed process, so the
#           hook warns.
#   2. a stage whose gate is not cleared
#        => a still-present .red marker means implementation is unfinished (a
#           failing test is on record and was never taken green). The verify stage
#           cannot have passed cleanly.
#        => artifacts present out of order, or a verification-report.md whose
#           gate decision is RED / blank, mean the verify stage was entered
#           and not cleared.
#   3. a hotfix with an outstanding follow-up
#        => the delivery-approach record names a hotfix and its outstanding
#           follow-ups section still has an unchecked item, or
#           acceptance-criteria.md still lacks the promoted reproduction
#           scenario.
#
# This mirrors what /compass:status reports, but fires automatically at
# session end, so an unfinished issue is reported at every session end.
