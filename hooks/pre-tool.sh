# Compass hook: pre-tool.sh  -  THE RED-BEFORE-GREEN STRATEGY ENFORCER
# =============================================================================
# Enforces the red-before-green strategy mechanically - in service of the
# guardrail that every change lands with a passing automated test covering it.
#
#   * The GUARDRAIL is the hard line: no code ships without a passing test it
#     traces to. It is checked at the verify stage and at ship time, with
#     evidence.
#   * Red-before-green is a STRATEGY - the strong, shipped-on *way* to satisfy
#     that guardrail. This hook enforces the strategy, and a strategy is aware
#     of the delivery approach.
#
# This hook therefore BLOCKS code edits with no failing test on record -
# EXCEPT on a spike, where the strategy is deliberately suspended so
# exploratory edits are not blocked. A spike still cannot cross the
# guardrail: nothing ships from a spike without being reassessed
# (`/compass:assess --reassess`) into a delivery approach first, where this
# hook applies in full.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   Runs as a Claude Code PreToolUse hook. On a tool call that edits or writes a
#   *code* file (not a test, not docs, not a Compass artifact):
#     - if the current issue is a spike (a ".spike" marker exists) → ALLOW.
#     - else, need a recorded failing test - a ".red" marker file under
#       .compass/work/<issue-slug>/. No .red marker → the edit is BLOCKED.
#
# THE MARKER CONVENTION
#   .compass/work/<issue-slug>/.red    "a failing test exists for this
#                                      issue". It is NOT a bare `touch` - it is
#                                      written by `compass tdd-red <test-cmd>`,
#                                      which runs the test, confirms it really
#                                      fails, writes evidence/red.json with the
#                                      command + exit code + log, and only THEN
#                                      drops the .red marker. So the marker
#                                      means "a real, observed failure is on
#                                      record", not "someone touched a file".
#     1. The implement stage: `compass tdd-red -- <your failing test command>`.
#     2. Edit the production code - this hook sees .red and allows it.
#     3. `compass tdd-green -- <test command>` confirms green, writes
#        evidence/green.json, and clears .red - the hand-off to the verify stage.
#   .compass/work/<issue-slug>/.spike  "this issue is a spike - the red-
#                                      before-green strategy is suspended".
#                                      /compass:assess
#                                      writes this when it composes a Spike.
#   Markers are deliberately plain files so they are inspectable and auditable;
#   the evidence/*.json records next to them are the audit trail.
#
# EXEMPTIONS
#   Test files, docs, config, and .compass/ artifacts are never blocked - you
#   must be able to write the failing test in the first place. A spike is the
#   deliberate exemption for exploratory work. There is no env var to disable
#   the check on delivery work: that would not be suspending a strategy, it
#   would be crossing the tested-before-ship guardrail.

# --- resolve the project this hook is enforcing -----------------------------
# The resolution order, and why each step exists:
#   1. The edited file's own path, when the tool call names one. It is the
#      only input that names the tree being changed - Compass creates git
#      worktrees at breakdown, so on a multiagent approach the session
#      directory and the edited file can be in different trees, and resolving
#      from the session reads the wrong project either way: it can miss a red
#      recorded in the edited tree, or borrow one recorded in the session's
#      tree.
#   2. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, when the tool call names no file (a Bash call with
#      no write target). The session is the best answer there.
#   3. The ancestor walk from that starting point up to the nearest
#      .compass/ directory, bounded by .git so the walk does not cross into
#      another repository.
#
# Not resolved from this script's own location: the hook is installed from
# the plugin cache, and Compass self-hosts, so its own tree has a .compass/
# of its own. Resolving from there would enforce the framework's own issue
# against the user's edits.

# directly, and again once a Bash command's target has been extracted

# nothing. The hook checks the marker first because it is cheap - this hook
# runs on every tool call, and globbing plus parsing JSON on each one is a
# constant cost - then reads the record in evidence/ to decide.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT BUY. `content_digest` is a plain sha256 over the
# record's own fields with no secret, so anyone who can write the file can
# compute a matching digest. This catches a record EDITED after it was
# written; it does not catch one FABRICATED wholesale by someone who knows the
# format. Forging goes from `touch` to writing plausible JSON with a correct
# digest - a different order of deliberateness, not an impossibility.
# docs/safety-contract.md states both halves.

  running a test and watching it fail; an empty file with the same name proves
  nothing, which is why this hook now reads what is beside it.

  To proceed the Compass way:
    1. Write the failing test for the scenario you are implementing.
    2. Record the red - run it through the CLI so the failure is observed
       and the evidence is captured:
         compass tdd-red -- <your failing test command>
       (this runs the test, confirms it fails, writes evidence/red.json,
        and drops the .red marker this hook checks for).
    3. Re-try this edit.

  Later, \`compass tdd-green -- <test command>\` confirms green, writes
  evidence/green.json, and clears the .red marker - the hand-off to Verify.

  If this is genuinely exploratory work, it should be a spike - re-run
  /compass:assess. The fix is to write the test or re-frame, not to route
  around the hook.
