# Compass - Runtime-Neutral Agent Instructions

This file is the portable expression of Compass. `CLAUDE.md` is the Claude
Code adapter; this file is the same intent without runtime-specific syntax,
for any other agent runtime (Codex, Amp, Cursor, OpenCode, a custom harness).

It speaks the frozen v2 vocabulary (`governance/terminology.yml`). Commands,
filenames and machine keys use their v2 names; a name that reads oddly
appears in code spans, as the machinery spells it.

Compass is built in three layers:

- **Methodology layer** - `docs/`, `governance/` `.md` files, the
  delivery-approach reference docs, `templates/` - *is* the framework, in
  plain markdown.
- **Kit layer** - `cli/compass`, `governance/*.yml`, `schemas/` (executable
  JSON Schema, draft-07, checked against when the optional `jsonschema`
  library is installed), the `manifest.yml` issue manifest - the
  deterministic mechanism: a plain CLI that bundles the one third-party
  library it needs (PyYAML, at `cli/vendor/yaml/` - see
  `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`), **not** runtime-specific.
- **Adapter layer** - wires both into one runtime.

Porting Compass means satisfying the contract below by rewriting *only the
adapter layer*: the methodology and kit layers are already runtime-neutral,
and a portable adapter must *shell out to the kit-layer CLI* for the
deterministic parts rather than reimplement them. See `docs/portability.md`
for the full contract.

## What any Compass runtime must do

**1. Assess before changing anything.** Before an issue changes code, specs,
or product artifacts, assess it: read the four assessment dimensions - risk,
familiarity, size, and goal. Reading the four dimensions is judgement, so the
runtime must do it. Composing the delivery approach *from* that assessment is
mechanism, not judgement: a portable runtime must shell out to
`compass approach evaluate` (the kit-layer CLI) rather than reimplement the
composition, so that the same assessment plus the same policy yield the same
approach on every runtime. The runtime records the assessment in the manifest
(`manifest.yml`), runs the evaluator, and writes the human-readable approach
record (`delivery-approach.md`). The approach is computed from context, not
chosen from a menu. Genuinely exploratory work is not exempt from
assessment - it composes a **spike**.

**Assess the work when the request describes it, not only when the command is typed.** When the user
describes intent to build, change, or fix code - even when they do not type
the adapter's assess command - the adapter must assess before any
artifact-changing tool call. Explicit invocation always works regardless. If
`.compass/current-task` already points at an assessed issue, do not
re-assess - proceed with the issue's recorded delivery approach. This
intent-recognition is an adapter responsibility (it is *when* to trigger
assessment, not what assessment does); methodology describes the stage,
this rule describes the trigger.

**2. Walk the eight-stage pipeline:**

1. assess
2. define acceptance criteria
3. requirements review
4. plan
5. break down the work
6. implement
7. test & review
8. ship

The delivery approach says which stages are full-weight, which collapse, and
which are skipped - and why. Each stage emits its artifact (templates in
`templates/`) to the issue's working directory.

**3. Enforce the guardrails - few, hard, never crossed:**
   - **Tested before it ships:** no code reaches `main` without a passing
     test it traces to.
   - **Acceptance defined before it is built:** no code without a stated,
     checkable acceptance criterion.
   - **Traceability:** code → criterion → intent, and claim → criterion.
   - **Evidence, not assertion:** guardrails clear with command output, not
     claims. The Definition of Done is itself a typed gate - every unchecked
     item must reference typed inline evidence as `(evidence: EV-<id>)` or a
     filed follow-up as `(follow-up: FU-<id>)`, or be ticked `[x]` if a human
     has actually done the work. Bare unchecked items fail `compass check`'s
     `dod-evidence-typed` rule. An adapter that emits Definition of Done
     output must emit it in this form.
   - **Human sign-off on the irreversible:** data, money, auth, privacy get a
     human checkpoint.

   **BDD and TDD are default *strategies*, not guardrails** - the strong,
   shipped-on way to satisfy the first two guardrails. A runtime enforces
   the red-before-green strategy *mechanically* when its own mechanism
   allows it (Claude Code uses a pre-tool hook that is aware of the
   delivery approach and does not block on a spike); otherwise it enforces
   it procedurally. But what a runtime must always enforce is the
   guardrail *outcome* (tested before it ships), not the ritual.

   The guardrail *checks* are mechanism, not judgement - so a portable
   runtime must run them via the kit-layer CLI rather than reimplement
   them: `compass check` runs the `governance/guardrails.yml` checks against
   the issue's manifest and `evidence/`, and `compass tdd-red` /
   `compass tdd-green` run a test, assert fail/pass, and write the evidence
   records the checks read. Gate evidence in the manifest is **typed** - a
   `{type, path}` record, not a bare path - and `guardrails.yml` declares
   which evidence types each gate accepts, so a mechanical gate cannot be
   cleared with a written note; `compass check` enforces that. The runtime's
   job is to *call* these at the right stages, not to re-derive what they do.
   The shipped guardrails and strategies apply with no setup; a project adds
   its own governance later.

   **Artifacts are written for a cold reader.** Every artifact a runtime
   emits is read later by someone who was not in the conversation, so it
   states its context before its detail, resolves its own references rather
   than pointing at a discussion, and stops when it has said the thing.
   Commit messages and pull-request bodies the runtime generates carry no
   agent co-author trailer and no "Generated with" footer; `devlog.md` and
   the manifest already record provenance in a form the framework can read.
   Like every strategy this is assessed at review, never gating.

**4. Support five roles, each with its own entry point.** Engineer, product
owner/manager, product marketer, designer, QA. Each has an entry point and
artifacts that plug into the same pipeline. The acceptance-criteria file is
the one file all five roles read - do not reduce it to an engineering-only
artifact.

**5. Support solo / pair / multiagent orchestrations.** On larger delivery
approaches, the plan stage produces a distribution map and the breakdown
stage parallelises across isolated workspaces (git worktrees in the
reference implementation), one agent per subtask, with a coordinating
orchestrator that owns integration at ship time. A runtime without
worktrees must give equivalent isolation or cap itself at solo/pair.

**6. Shell out for CI and the feedback loop too.** Two cross-issue kit
commands complete the contract, and a portable runtime must call them
rather than reinvent them. `compass ci` runs the full mechanical gate suite
(`policy lint` + `issue lint` + `check` for every issue) and aggregates exit
codes - the CI integration is "run `compass ci`, honour the exit code" (see
`ci/README.md`). `compass retro` aggregates the `reassessments` log across
issues and reports whether assessment is systematically over- or under-sizing
the process - the framework's own retrospective signal. The adapter wires
these into the runtime's CI and reporting surfaces; it does not re-derive
them.

## What a runtime adapter must give

| Methodology concept | Adapter must map it to… |
|---|---|
| The eight stages | Invocable commands or equivalent |
| Assess | A routine that produces the assessment, then *calls the kit* (`compass approach evaluate`) to compose the delivery approach |
| The kit-layer CLI | A shell-out, not a reimplementation - the adapter runs `compass approach evaluate`, `compass check`, `compass tdd-red/green`, and `compass analyze` (cross-artifact consistency check) for the deterministic parts |
| CI and the feedback loop | A shell-out to `compass ci` (honour the exit code), `compass retro` (the retrospective signal), `compass rework-scan` (cross-issue rework signal), and `compass flow` (cross-issue view; `--digest` writes a dated digest combining rework-scan and the retrospective signal) |
| Subagents (`router`, `spec-author`, `planner`, `orchestrator`, `builder`, `verifier`, `reviewer`, `product-owner`, `product-marketer`, `architect`) | Distinct agent contexts or personas. The 10th - `architect` - applies the architect perspective (not an entry-point role): reads the project's `architecture/` artifacts (system-context, relations, ownership, decision records) at the assess stage and annotates the technical design via `architecture-notes.md`. Consulted by `spec-author` and `planner`; never writes feature code |
| Skills | Loadable procedural-knowledge modules |
| Guardrail enforcement | `compass check` for the mechanical checks; hooks if available for red-before-green, procedural checks otherwise |
| Role entry points | Distinct session-start modes |
| Per-issue next-step + follow-up management | The adapter wires `compass next` (surface the next action on the current issue) and `compass follow-up resolve` (mark an owed follow-up as settled) into its issue-resumption and shipping flows |
| Decision-record creation | `compass adr new` (creates a numbered decision record under `architecture/decisions/`) - the adapter exposes this in whatever shape its agents use for recording architectural decisions |

The kit layer (`cli/compass`, `governance/*.yml`, `schemas/`, `manifest.yml`) is
itself runtime-neutral - an adapter does not rewrite it, it invokes it. The
only thing the adapter owes the kit is a `.compass/current-task` pointer (or
an explicit `--issue` slug) so the CLI can resolve which issue it is acting
on.

## Writing voice

Every artifact a runtime writes is prose someone reads later, and prose that
narrates the pipeline instead of communicating a decision teaches nothing.
`skills/compass-runtime/writing-voice.md` states the rule in one line,
carries real before/after pairs harvested from this project's own archive,
and names the tells that mark the narrating kind. A runtime's session-facing
output - devlog entries, requirements reviews, replies to the person driving
it - must read the way that reference asks: what happened, what is
needed, never which stage is running.

### Plain English

These rules apply to everything a runtime writes for a person: a reply, a
devlog entry, a commit message, a code comment, a PR description, a document.
The reader has no context and must get the point on the first read.

- Lead with the point: the finding first, then the evidence.
- Use the active voice. Name the actor, then the action.
- Use a simple tense: present, past or future.
- Put one point in each sentence. A sentence much past 25 words is usually
  two points.
- Use the same word for the same thing every time, including the v2 terms in
  `governance/terminology.yml`.
- Do not use an idiom or a metaphor. Say what happens instead: not "the
  direction of travel", but what is changing and towards what.
- Describe how things are now, not the story of how they got there.
- Never cite what the reader cannot see, such as "Option 2", an internal review
  number, or an id without its name.
- State the confidence: "this fails" for a thing checked, "I have not checked
  this" for a thing not checked.
- Use a vertical list for a set of items, conditions or steps.
- Use "must" for a requirement, "can" for a possibility and "do not" for a
  prohibition.
- Use British English, except "artifact". It is also a manifest key and a
  command name, so prose spells it the same way.

Use the shorter word:

| Not | Use |
|---|---|
| utilise, leverage | use |
| obtain, acquire | get |
| provide, supply | give |
| indicate, denote | show |
| validate | check |
| modify, alter | change |
| require | need |
| ensure | make sure |
| perform, execute | do |
| facilitate | help |
| attempt | try |
| sufficient | enough |
| currently | now |
| subsequently | then |
| prior to | before |
| in order to | to |
| due to the fact that | because |
| with regard to | about |

### Reporting to the person driving the runtime

Read a report back for terms of art before sending it; afterwards is too late,
because a reader cannot re-read a spoken sentence. Give it four parts:

- what I did;
- outstanding questions, numbered when there is more than one;
- what I need from you;
- what I intend to do next.

Sections stay short, a snippet sits under the point it belongs to, and a
large change may run long - cut the account of how the work went, never the
substance. Each heading answers a question the reader already has, which is
what shows any jargon.

## State on disk

All issue state is files, not conversation:

- `governance/` at the project root - the `.md` files and the `.yml` files
  the CLI runs - or the framework's shipped defaults if a project has not run
  init;
- per-issue artifacts in a `.compass/work/<issue-slug>/` directory, including
  `manifest.yml` (the manifest) and `evidence/` (the CLI's test and gate
  records);
- when the project ships an `architecture/` directory, two derived files the
  assess stage writes when present: `architecture-loaded.yml` (the per-issue
  snapshot of which cross-issue architectural state was loaded) and
  `architecture-notes.md` (annotations the architect perspective writes on
  the technical design, *not* a parallel spec);
- a `.compass/current-task` pointer so the CLI and any hooks resolve the
  current issue unambiguously.

A different session, agent, or runtime must be able to resume an issue by
reading the approach record (`delivery-approach.md`), the manifest, and the
artifacts - nothing essential lives only in context.
