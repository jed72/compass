# Compass

**Adaptive spec-driven development for Claude Code.**

> Enough process for the work at hand. No more.

A typo fix should not need an architecture pack. A payments rewrite should
not begin with an unstructured prompt.

Compass assesses each change by **risk, familiarity, size and intent**, then
composes the right delivery approach: the artefacts worth writing, the checks
worth running, the human decisions required and the number of agents that can
work safely in parallel.

Assess the work. Let policy choose the process.

## Start here

Install Compass from inside Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add jed72/compass
/plugin install compass@compass
```

Requires Python 3. Compass CI currently tests Python 3.11.

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jed72/compass.git
cd compass
bash scripts/install.sh --global
```

Add `bin/` to your `PATH` to make `compass` invokable, or call it as
`python3 cli/compass`.

Then describe the work:

```text
/compass:assess "Add rate limiting to the public API"
```

Compass assesses the issue, works out the approach and tells you what needs
review next. The default guardrails work immediately; project setup is
optional.

Compass complements your normal CI. It does not replace tests, linting,
security scanning, builds or deployment checks.

Want the guided walkthrough? Read **[Compass in five minutes](docs/five-minutes.md)**.
Writing the artefacts is its own craft: see
[docs/writing-specs-and-plans.md](docs/writing-specs-and-plans.md).

## What Compass changes

Most spec-driven development systems choose one workflow and apply it to
everything. Compass adapts the depth without abandoning discipline.

| Work | Typical Compass response |
|---|---|
| **Quick fix** | One clear criterion, a focused change and evidence that it works. |
| **Feature** | Behavioural specification in Gherkin, proportionate technical design and review. |
| **Initiative** | intent document, architecture and delivery plan, with detailed design and test strategy only where useful. |
| **Hotfix** | Reproduce first, fix safely, then pay back the ceremony borrowed for speed. |
| **Spike** | Time-boxed exploration. Record the learning; ship nothing directly. |

These are reference shapes, not fixed levels. A one-file authentication change
can receive more protection than a large throwaway prototype because risk and
size are different things.

## Resumable and auditable

Every issue leaves a reviewable record under `.compass/work/<issue>/`:

- a dashboard showing the current decision and what needs approval;
- the delivery approach, including what was deliberately omitted and why;
- only the product, requirements, design, test and release artefacts justified
  by the work;
- traceable evidence behind each gate; and
- enough state for another session (or another compatible agent runtime) to
  resume without relying on chat history.

The terminal gives you the decision and the document to read. Detailed policy
output and test logs stay available as evidence rather than taking over the
conversation.

## Rigour without ritual

Compass separates two things that process frameworks often confuse:

- **Guardrails** are hard, checkable and blocking: tested before shipping,
  acceptance defined before implementation, traceability, evidence rather
  than assertion, and human approval for irreversible changes.
- **Strategies** are strong defaults that improve the work without becoming
  bureaucracy: BDD, TDD, ADRs, visual architecture models and other practices
  that apply when they add value.

Judgement goes into the assessment. Everything after it is deterministic: the
same assessment plus the same policy produces the same approach, every time.

## One delivery language

```text
assess → define → plan → implement → verify → ship
```

The stages stay recognisable while their depth adapts. Each role enters the
same issue through its own command. For example, a product owner can start
upstream with `/compass:intent`; see the
**[roles guide](docs/roles-guide.md)** for the others.

## Built to port

Compass runs on Claude Code today, but its core is split deliberately:

- **Methodology:** plain-language guidance, governance and templates.
- **Kit:** the runtime-neutral Python CLI, schemas and policy engine.
- **Adapter:** the commands, agents, skills and hooks for Claude Code.

A future runtime adapter calls the same kit rather than reimplementing the
rules.

## The CLI

The slash commands are the pipeline; the CLI is the mechanism underneath them.
`/compass:assess` runs `compass approach evaluate`, `/compass:verify` runs
`compass check`. It is what makes the checks real rather than aspirational.

```text
compass init               make this directory a Compass project - create .compass/
compass approach evaluate  the assessment -> the delivery approach, deterministically
compass bdd extract        acceptance criteria -> a runnable .feature
compass bdd verify         record which scenarios the runner actually ran
compass check              run the guardrail checks against the manifest and evidence
compass analyze            where an issue's artifacts disagree with each other
compass retro              is triage systematically over- or under-sizing the process?
compass ci                 the full mechanical gate suite, for continuous integration
compass tdd-red            run a test, assert it FAILS, record the red
compass tdd-green          run a test, assert it PASSES, record the green
compass policy lint        structurally validate the governance YAML
compass plan lint          scan a technical design for placeholder phrases
compass intent ingest      read a brief that already exists, by path or https URL
compass issue lint         structurally validate an issue manifest
compass issue receipt      one screen: assessment, approach, gates, evidence
compass issue dashboard    the per-issue review page
compass issue artifact     set a document's status in the review pack
compass issue set-status   queued | active | parked | landed | abandoned
compass acceptance start   open an honest record where there is no natural red
compass acceptance record  close it with what was observed
compass adr new            create the next numbered decision record
compass rework-scan        add-then-delete patterns across issues
compass flow               blockers, owed follow-ups, the periodic digest
compass next               which stage this issue reached, and what comes next
compass follow-up resolve  settle an owed follow-up
compass ship-commit        commit exactly the files the issue recorded
compass gate pass          mark a gate passed, validating the evidence type
compass scenario add       add a scenario to the manifest
compass changed-file add   trace a changed file to the scenario that asked for it
compass evidence add       append a typed evidence record
compass migrate            bring older issue directories up to the current schema
compass terminology        what a term means here, from the frozen vocabulary
```

Every verb describes itself - `compass <verb> --help` says what it does and
what the result means, so this list is a map rather than a manual.

## What's in the box

```
commands/     the stage interface, under the /compass: namespace
agents/       distinct contexts - router, spec-author, planner, builder,
              verifier, reviewer, product-owner, product-marketer, architect
skills/       loadable procedures - adaptive-routing, bdd-specification,
              tdd-discipline, worktree-multiagent, intent-interview and the rest
hooks/        pre-tool.sh, post-tool.sh, stop.sh - mechanical enforcement
cli/compass   the kit: routing, checks and the manifest
bin/compass   the shim that puts the kit on your PATH
governance/   guardrails, strategies, routing policy, frozen vocabulary
approaches/   the reference shapes, and the artefacts each one earns
architecture/ Compass's own invariants and decision records
.claude-plugin/  the plugin manifest and marketplace entry
```

The first four are the Claude Code adapter and are rebuilt for another
runtime. Everything below them is reused unchanged.

## Roles are full citizens

Five roles, four of them non-engineering, each with an entry point and its own
artefacts: engineer, product owner, designer, product marketer and QA. A
non-engineering entry point changes the delivery approach rather than adding a
consultation - see the [roles guide](docs/roles-guide.md).
