# What a scenario is, and what makes one good

Split out of `SKILL.md`: reference on qualities, granularity and how depth scales - consulted while writing, not before starting.

## What a scenario is

```
Scenario: <a behaviour, named as an outcome>
  Given <the world is in this concrete, specific state>
  When  <exactly one triggering action happens>
  Then  <this observable, checkable outcome holds>
```

A scenario is a single behaviour with a single trigger. It is concrete enough
that someone could execute it by hand and concrete enough that a test can
assert it automatically - those are the same bar.

## The qualities of a good scenario

- **Concrete state.** "Given a user" is too vague. "Given a user with a
  verified email and no active subscription" can be set up and asserted.
- **One When.** Two actions in `When` means two scenarios. The trigger is
  singular.
- **Observable Then.** The outcome must be checkable from outside - a returned
  value, a stored state, a rendered element, an emitted event. "Then it works"
  is not a Then. "Then the response is 402 and no charge row is written" is.
- **Declarative, not procedural.** Describe *what* is true, not the click-path
  to get there. The implementation can change; the behaviour should not.
- **Named as an outcome.** "Scenario: expired token is rejected" beats
  "Scenario: test token". The name is the first thing the PM, marketer, and QA
  read.

## Scenario granularity - splitting and merging

- **Split** when a scenario has an "and" in its `When`, or branches in its
  `Then` ("Then either X or Y"), or needs a paragraph of `Given` - those are
  multiple behaviours wearing one name.
- **Merge** when two scenarios differ only in an incidental value and assert the
  same behaviour - use a scenario outline / examples table instead of copying.
- The unit is *one behaviour*, not one feature and not one line of code. A
  feature is a set of scenarios; a line of code traces *up* to a scenario but is
  not one-to-one with it.

## How depth scales with the delivery approach

The vocabulary never changes. The depth does - and the approach tells you
how much.

- **Quick fix** - exactly one scenario. The happy path of the new
  behaviour, no more. If you cannot capture it in one unambiguous
  scenario, the assessment was misread: it is not a quick fix. Say so and
  send it back to triage.
- **Feature** - a small scenario set: the happy path, the realistic edges,
  and the failure modes that actually matter. Not every conceivable edge -
  the ones with real consequence.
- **Initiative** - full discovery. Work `intent.md` and the problem space for
  the whole behaviour set. Then **group the scenarios by independence** - disjoint
  code, disjoint scenarios - because that grouping is what seeds the
  distribution map the Planner builds.
- **Hotfix** - the scenario *is* a failing regression test that
  reproduces the defect. It is written reproduce-first, before any fix,
  and it is simultaneously the BDD scenario and the TDD red. At ship time
  it gets promoted into a properly-formed Given/When/Then scenario as
  part of the mandatory follow-up.
- **Spike** - the BDD strategy does **not** run. A spike has no acceptance
  criteria - its output is knowledge, not behaviour - so the define stage
  collapses to the *question* ("what do we need to learn, and what would
  a useful answer look like?") and the requirements review is skipped.
  You write no scenario file on a spike. If the spike graduates, real
  scenarios are written when it re-assesses into a delivery approach,
  where acceptance-before-code applies in full.
