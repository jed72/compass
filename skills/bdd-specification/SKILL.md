# BDD Specification

**BDD is a strategy, not a guardrail** - expressing acceptance criteria
as Given/When/Then scenarios. It is the strong, shipped-on default way to
satisfy the **acceptance-before-code guardrail**: *acceptance defined
before it is built - stated, and checkable*. Keep that relationship
straight.

- **Acceptance-before-code is the guardrail** - hard, checkable. No code is written that no stated,
  checkable acceptance criterion describes. The outcome - acceptance is stated
  and it is checkable - is non-negotiable on every delivery approach.
- **BDD is the strategy** - Given/When/Then is the *form*. It is strong and
  shipped-on, but it is a strategy: a context where the form genuinely does not
  fit is a recorded strategy deviation, not a framework violation. The hard
  line is that acceptance exists and is checkable; G/W/G is the default way to
  make it so.

In Compass the BDD spec is not documentation that precedes the tests - it *is*
the tests, read at a different time. `acceptance-criteria.md` is written once at
the define stage and run as the acceptance check at verify. It is also the one artifact
five roles read (see `role-translation`). Write it knowing all of that.

## Example-first refinement chain

In `skills/bdd-specification/refinement-chain.md`.

## The Summary comes before the scenarios

A spec opens with a **Summary** in prose, above the role-guide block, before a
single Given/When/Then. Three fields:

- **Goal** - one sentence, what this change delivers in user terms.
- **Approach** - two to three sentences, the shape of the change at the level a
  perspective reviewer would want.
- **Why now / what changes** - one short paragraph, the visible outcome and what
  an adjacent role would notice afterwards.

This is the **cold-reader** strategy (write for a cold reader) applied to the spec itself. A
reviewer opening a spec they did not write should be able to say what is being
built and why before deciding whether to read the scenarios in detail. Without
it they have to synthesise that picture from the Gherkin - easy for the author,
progressively harder for everyone else, and the point at which review quietly
stops happening.

The Summary is **additive**. It does not replace scenarios, and it is not a
place to restate them. Length scales with the route the same way scenario depth
does: quick-fix one to two sentences per field, Standard ordinary paragraphs,
initiative up to 200 words per field where the work warrants it.

## Self-review before the requirements review

When `acceptance-criteria.md` is written, run these four scans over it yourself before
handing off. **Fix what you find inline** - edit the spec directly. Do not write
a review artifact, and do not invoke a reviewer agent or subagent for this.

1. **Placeholder scan** - any unfilled `{{...}}` left in the file, including the
   three Summary fields (Goal, Approach, Why now / what changes). An unfilled
   Summary is the most common one, because it is written first and easiest to
   defer.
2. **Orphan-intent scan** - every `INT-n` in the intent-links table has at least
   one scenario serving it. An intent with no scenario is a stated outcome
   nobody agreed to check.
3. **Untestable-Then scan** - any `Then` phrased as "it works", "is correct",
   "behaves properly", or "feels right". If it cannot fail, it cannot pass.
4. **Ambiguous-quantifier scan** - "quickly", "large", "most", "soon" with no
   number attached. Either attach the number or cut the word.

**This complements the requirements review; it does not replace it.**
The review still runs on feature and heavier approaches, and it does
things this cannot: it QAs the spec against governance, resolves
contradictions, and records an ambiguity ledger with owners. The
self-check is simply what a spec-author owes the reviewer - the cheap
findings fixed by whoever made them, so the review's attention goes to
the questions that actually need a decision.

### The split, stated plainly

The two overlap enough that a reader meeting both wonders which is redundant.
Neither is. They differ in *who does them*, *what they cost*, and *what kind of
finding they can produce*.

| | Inline self-review (define stage) | Requirements review (its own stage) |
|---|---|---|
| **Who** | the spec-author, alone | spec-author plus reviewer; every role on an initiative |
| **Cost** | minutes - four mechanical scans over one file | a stage; requires reading, and often a human decision |
| **Finds** | placeholder, orphan-intent, untestable-`Then`, ambiguous-quantifier | contradictions between scenarios, gaps across the whole set, governance conflicts, ambiguities that need someone to *choose* |
| **Output** | edits to `acceptance-criteria.md`, in place | `requirements-review.md` - a ledger with a resolution and an owner per entry |
| **Approaches** | every approach, including the quick fix | feature and heavier; collapsed on quick fixes and hotfixes, skipped on spikes |

The dividing line: **the self-review fixes what one person can see and
settle alone; the requirements review resolves what needs a decision.** An unfilled placeholder has
one correct answer and the author already knows it. "Do these two scenarios
contradict each other, and which one is wrong?" does not - and pretending
otherwise is how a spec ships with a fork still in it.

The review does not re-run the four scans. If it finds one of them still
open, that means the self-review was skipped: worth saying so, not worth
silently absorbing.

**On a quick fix, where the review is collapsed, this self-check *is*
the QA.** Record
that you ran it, and what it found, in `devlog.md`. A self-check that happened
only in conversation did not happen (persistence over conversation).

*Why there is no subagent critic here.* The Superpowers project shipped a
subagent review loop between spec and plan and then removed it, reporting
regression testing across five versions and five trials that found identical
quality scores whether the loop ran or not, at roughly 25 minutes of overhead
per run. Compass has not repeated that measurement and takes the published
result at face value. Compass already has
two review points that earn their cost: **the requirements review**, which
QAs the spec against governance, and the **reviewer** agent at verify. A
third pass between them would double the time without measurably
improving the spec.

## What a scenario is

In `skills/bdd-specification/scenario-craft.md`.

## The requirements review - QA the spec against itself and against governance

The requirements review is where the spec is verified *as a spec*, before
anyone builds from it.
Walk it for:

- **Contradictions** - two scenarios that cannot both hold.
- **Gaps** - a stated outcome (or a brief success signal) with no scenario.
- **Untestable Thens** - outcomes that cannot be observed from outside.
- **Ambiguous quantifiers** - "quickly", "most", "large" with no number.
- **Governance conflicts** - scenarios that cross a guardrail (a project
  coverage or security floor, an irreversible-surface rule) or that depart from
  an applicable strategy without a recorded reason. A guardrail conflict is a
  must-fix; a strategy departure is a note and a conversation.

Record each ambiguity, its resolution, and who resolved it in
`requirements-review.md`. The requirements review may be *light* on a feature; it may be *collapsed*
on quick-fix only because the one scenario was certified unambiguous; it is
*skipped* on Spike because the unknown is the point; it is never simply
*absent* where the route or a routing guardrail calls for it.

## Anti-patterns

- **The implementation scenario** - `Given the cache is warm, When flushCache()
  is called…`. That tests the code's shape, not its behaviour. Scenarios outlive
  implementations.
- **The unfalsifiable Then** - "Then the user has a good experience." If it
  cannot fail, it cannot pass; it is not a scenario.
- **The orphan-creating spec** - leaving real behaviour with no scenario.
  The acceptance-before-code guardrail forbids code that no stated acceptance criterion describes; the
  spec is where you prevent the orphan, not Verify.
- **The novel** - a scenario with five `Given` lines and three `When` lines.
  Split it.
